<strong> Know When to Hold ‘Em</strong> In early 2013, Real Salt Lake owner Dell Loy Hanson made the decision not to extend Jason Kreis’s contract, gambling that Kreis’s stock would come down and he would be able to nab the coach at a bargain price. After all, the club had just lost Will Johnson, Jamison Olave, Fabian Espindola, and Jonny Steele in an offseason filled with cost-cutting moves. 2013 seemed likely to be a rebuilding year. Twelve months and two cup finals later, Jason Kreis is preparing for the 2015 debut of New York City <span class="caps">FC</span>, leaving Jeff Cassar, promoted from assistant coach, to lead Real Salt Lake. Cassar, with the team since 2007, is a safe choice, but even with all 11 starters returning, he may find it difficult to replicate the kind of success that RSL achieved under Jason Kreis. <strong>In Good Hands</strong> <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/2014-rsl-roster-2014-02-241.png" alt="2014 RSL Roster - 2014-02-24"> <strong>**Nick Rimando returns to man the <span class="caps">RSL</span> nets for the 8<span class="ord">th</span> consecutive season. There’s nothing much that can be said about Rimando that you probably don’t already know. A 14-year veteran of the league, Rimando has ascended to third in command of the United States net. Remarkably, Rimando has a 10-0-0 record with the U.S. team, and is already tied for 5<span class="ord">th</span> all-time on the goalkeeper victory list with Brad Guzan. Rimando’s national team opportunities have come as a result of stellar club play. Last season, he finished 2<span class="ord">nd</span> to Donovan Ricketts in Goalkeeper of the Year award voting, and was probably unlucky to do so. Rimando really is the total package: His </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYpEGAKFud0">reflexes and shot-stopping ability</a><strong> are legendary, and while it may not surprise you that Rimando finished 4<span class="ord">th</span> in pass completion percentage, the diminutive Rimando is also an excellent commander of his penalty area. In 2014, Rimando finished 4<span class="ord">th</span> in <span class="caps">MLS</span> in catches per 90 with 2.63. This paragraph is far too long for one that could have been summed up simply with “Real Salt Lake is in good hands with Nick Rimando.” </strong>Continuity in the Back<strong> With Chris Wingert, Nat Borchers, Chris Schuler, and Tony Beltran patrolling in front of him, Nick Rimando, too, will be in good hands. In the playoffs, Borchers and Schuler showed the potential to become one of the best pairings in the league. Though that is contingent on whether Schuler can remain healthy. In both the 2012 and 2013 seasons, Schuler was sidelined for multiple months with a foot injury. It was evident just how much Salt Lake missed Schuler last season when he was injured: with Schuler on the field last season, <span class="caps">RSL</span> conceded only 0.94 goals per 90, without him, they conceded 1.45 goals per 90. Yes, the sample size is small, and no, these numbers do not take into account opponent and location of the game. Still, Schuler’s contributions to defense were evident when 20-year old Carlos Salcedo was forced to step in. Nat Borchers provides much more certainty. In his 9-year Major League Soccer career (he spent two years with Odd Grenland in Norway), Borchers has averaged more than 28 starts per season. </strong><img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/rslinfo.png?w=182" alt="RSLinfo">The Best Defense…** However, for all they do defensively, it may be their contributions to the attack that makes the <span class="caps">RSL</span> backline so valuable. Nat Borchers is one of the calmest defensive distributers in the league. Last season he had the 3<span class="ord">rd</span> best pass completion rate in the league, behind only Osvaldo Alonso and George John. This may be because Real Salt Lake puts a premium on possession and building the attack from the back, which sees Beckerman and the rest of the midfielders providing outlet options constantly. The team led MLS last season in possession percentage, pass success percentage, and percentage of passes that were under 25 yards. After all, Kwame Watson-Siriboe finished with a 93% passing rate (in but a mere handful of games), and Carlos Salcedo and Schuler both finished above&nbsp;80%.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>Since the club arrived in Houston <strong>Dominic Kinnear</strong> has built himself an empire, but not one built off big names or flashy play. Playing on the smallest pitch in <span class="caps">MLS</span>, the club is built on sound fundamentals. Defense might not necessarily win games but it can secure points on the road. Combine that with the fortress that has been the Orange’s BBVA Compass stadium—where they went an MLS record 36 home games without a loss stretching multiple seasons—and Houston can get points anywhere consistently. They’ve made the playoffs 7 out of their 8 years since arriving in Space City, so the goal of 2014 isn’t just to make the playoffs. It’s about getting back to the MLS Cup and taking it back for the first time since&nbsp;2007. </p>

<h3 id="-"> </h3>
<h3 id="2014-preview">2014&nbsp;Preview</h3>
<p><img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/houinfo.png?w=182" alt="HOUINFO"> The core of Houston has always been built around their defense, but this season may prove to be a bit of a departure from that theme. The club chose to decline <strong>Bobby Boswell</strong>‘s contract and instead went with a rotating duo of veterans at centerback to be paired with Jamaican stalwart<strong> Jermaine Taylor</strong>.<strong> Eric Brunner</strong> and <strong>David Horst</strong>, both 28, aren’t the sexiest names in regards to defense, but then again defense is generally the least sexy place on the pitch. When you consider the fact that this is normally a strength, falling backwards now to Brunner and Horst is probably a less than appealing subject for those in Houston. <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/hou-roster.png" alt="Hou-Roster">That said, I established a rule two years ago. I have a series of rules that I generally come up with in dealing with life in general. These rules aren’t so much rules as just helpful guidlines that generally keep me from more problems. High on that list is to never, ever bet against Dominic Kinnear. (Right after never betting at all because it’s a misdemeanor in Washington). The guy just knows A) how to get to the playoffs and B) how to put together a roster. Probably in the opposite order, though. The cheaper tandem along the backline helps them conserve cash while still providing depth and coverage at an important position. Considering the club failed to make the <span class="caps">CCL</span> this year, they were faced with a smaller budget to keep the players they had and still find reasonable depth for the season. There is, of course, the question about how big of a defensive drop off they are going to experience from Boswell to someone like Brunner. But considering our numbers have Tally Hall as one of the top goal keepers in the league, and they don’t even pay him anywhere near it, the Dynamo should remain a top defensive team. While everyone likes to rant and rave about <strong>Brad Davis</strong> and his left foot, as the career leader in both assists and goals for the club, it’s easy to pass over <strong>Oscar Boniek Garcia</strong> the other major attacking threat from the midfield. <span class="caps">OBG</span> led the club in key passes with 76 and added 18 total shots, as well. Another one of those is lesser heralded moves was Alexander Lopez being added from Honduras. Lopez, a member of the U-23 national team and possibly an option for the Honduras World cup team, was brought into the club last summer. Though Lopez was mostly invisible to the scoring operations taking place in Houston last season, Garcia has taken him under his wing this off-season and is helping to groom his fellow countryman. Adding to the fire that is burning bright with the under-appreciated pieces that Houston has assembled, there is plenty of talk around what another season with <strong>Warren Creavalle</strong> might mean to the Orange. He’s a Swiss-army-knife-like defensive piece in a love-child-like mix of <strong>Brad Evans</strong> and <strong>Geoff Cameron.* </strong>The former Georgia product is growing by leaps and bounds over the last 12 months. He may not be a clear cut choice to start at this point for the Dynamo’s <span class="caps">XI</span>, but he’s going to be the first player off the bench to fill into just about any position in the midfield or defensive back line, and that flexibility has huge value over an entire season. <em>*Editor’s note: The editor is just going to let this sit there.</em> The remaining question is how Will Bruin performs in 2014. The dancing bear should be good for about 10 goals or more this season. He’s put up near 3 shots per 90 minutes played each of the past two years, and while those chances becoming goals is dependent more on location, he’s seen a bit of bad luck strike him at times where, in the year previous, those balls bounced his way. Paired along side English journeyman Giles Barnes—who looks to have perhaps found a home this past year, scoring 9 goals on 97 shots through 2500 minutes—Houston has multiple wonder-strikers from distance. It’s one thing to be lucky; it’s another to find goals because of the courage to continue to fire the shots. The Dynamo found a way to keep the group of players they recruited for 2013 together for another run of it in 2014, despite declining payroll and allocation funds. They’ve got youth on their side with a touch of growing strength, added to one of the most brilliant coaches in the league managing them. I wouldn’t be surprised if they had a top-3 finish with a boring run through the schedule. The other side of things is that they’re going to have a tough time of it with the likes of Philadelphia, Toronto, <span class="caps">DC</span> and even Columbus all being improved sides, that they could end up on the outside looking in when the playoffs come rolling around. It’s definitely a tough year to be in the&nbsp;East. </p>

But what they have done is built off plenty of American Soccer history that surrounds Chester, <span class="caps">PA</span>. They’ve taken time to acknowledge the roots that were here in the country long before MLS and even NASL, embroidering the once famous American club <a href="http://bethlehemsteelsoccer.org/index.html">Bethlehem Steel</a> logo on both the back and inside of their third kit introduced last season. This is easily one of my favorite things about any third kit out there.

Are they too young? Can <strong>Maurice Edu</strong> and <strong>Austin Berry</strong> be enough to limit the <span class="caps">WW</span>-II-like gun fire shots that destroyed <strong>Zach MacMath</strong>‘s confidence and their play-off chances in 2013? Can Jack Mac finally score goals on a consistent basis? Oh, and can someone finally explain what the heck is #<span class="caps">DOOP</span>? The club won only three of its last 12 games over the final three months, compiling a paltry total of 12 points over that period. I think it’s kind of funny that the Union’s answer to that would be to seemingly to kick their young goalkeeper in the balls. Maybe that’s not entirely fair to the front office, as picking up goalkeeper <strong>Andre Blake</strong> wasn’t necessarily about improving right now, or even about MacMath’s performance last season. Yet it seems, albeit a bit unfairly, that some of the blame of their collapse is attributed to him and how he performed. Again, I’m not down with that narrative that MacMath had a direct hand in the club flailing about at the end. Surrendering 14 goals over a 12 game stretch and not winning is less about how one individual performed and more about the team as a whole. It’s important to understand that goal totals over any specific time period isn’t ever a true representation of talent, as it’s impossible to say from that tally how many shots were attempted and the quality of them. If the opposition only fired 14 shots over those 12 games and they were from outrageous locations, such as some where deep in the midfield, then we’d all be appalled with his lack of skill. This isn’t the case with MacMath and the reality is that during that time the Zolos went five games without scoring, and their opponents went seven games without scoring. While there was disappointment by the fan base, I feel that the front office tried to fix something that wasn’t broken. Sure, they upgraded the defense, and adding Maurice Edu to the midfield is only going to further help and strengthen that back line. These were all general problems that weren’t going to be real hampers when considering whether they had enough talent to get into the playoffs. I’ve already mentioned the whole problem of dropping points due to the lack of goals, and the goal-scoring drought of Jack McInerney certainly did not help. Going from June to October without scoring goals was a deeply frustrating time for the striker, as he’d admitted in several interviews. Only 21 years old, he’s already seen time with the <span class="caps">USMNT</span> being called up to the Gold Cup roster. Though remaining uncapped, it was a great opportunity for the young striker. Unfortunately, his return to Philly seems to coincide with the point where he completely “collapsed.” Now, <a href="http://11tegen11.net/2014/02/15/how-to-scout-a-striker/">people are still trying to identify whether</a> or not goal-scoring ability is really about putting a ball where you want it versus the quantity/quality of the shots that are generated by the individual. I’m personally of the belief that there has to be an in between for those two possibilities. Though at the professional level the question of whether or not it matters, or if there exist significant finishing gaps between strikers, is an interesting discussion. McInerney is obviously one of these strange cases to consider. Bestowed as the ‘American Chicharito’ it’s been said that he’s always in the right place at the right time. This is basically the secret to Wondolowski’s success, and it might highlight why he also went through his own scoring drought, but I think it also has something to do with the lack of support from the midfield creating chances. The additions of both Cristian Maidana and Vincent Nogueira suggests that this year’s midfield will be an improved one for creating goal-scoring opportunities. While it’s impossible to say how these new imports will fair in <span class="caps">MLS</span>, we’ve seen success from other attacking midfield Argentinians over the last couple of years, and it will be interesting to see if Maidana will follow in the foot steps of Morales and&nbsp;Valeri.</p>

A young Donovan helped to lead San Jose to MLS Cup wins in 2001 and 2003. But after the 2005 season, the ownership group grew tired of failing to embezzle funds from Silicon Valley’s tax payers and moved head coach Dominic Kinnear and the rest of the team to Houston.
