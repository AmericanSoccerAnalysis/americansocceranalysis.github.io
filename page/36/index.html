          <section class="content"><p>My apologies for the timeliness of the podcast being deployed. At the latest, I usually try to get it up by noon on Sunday. Of course, that didn’t happen and you were subjected to my useless apologies that are as common as San Jose yellow cards. Anyway…  I spent the last week out among the gentle Dallas folk spending time with family. It was the last week that my wife’s doctor permitted travel out of our local area (ya’ know, she’s preggers). Since I was out of pocket, Drew and Matthias picked up the responsibility for the podcast and did a great job. They talked <span class="caps">US</span> Mens National Team, finally finished up our review of the Eastern Conference standings, added some US Open Cup talk, and closed out the show previewing the Portland Timbers and LA Galaxy match later on this week. Have a listen: [audio <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/asa-episode-9.mp3">http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/asa-episode-9.mp3</a>]</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>So last week, ironically at about this exact time, I wrote about WhoScored entering the realm of American soccer and how awesome and exciting it was that they were going to start providing and publishing statistics for <span class="caps">MLS</span>—-allowing us to skip the process of having to count up all the individual games, not to mention the time-consuming tables that Matty puts together. Now we have much of that information at our convenient disposal. Well we are getting even more spoiled as now Squawka joins the fray of MLS statistics. If you haven’t been to Squawka yet, you need to visit their site. It’s not just a great collection of information, it’s visually stimulating and helps put things into a context, helping to convey a message better than some writers, especially me, can convey. This isn’t just an awesome thing because it makes mine as well as my associates’ lives easier. It’s awesome because it’s adding to what WhoScored does, not competing with them. This isn’t FanGraphs vs. Baseball-Reference where you have similar but altogether different ways of arriving at thoughts and ideas that really confuse the hell out of you—-like when you are trying to come up with whether or not <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3830&amp;position=P">Ricky</a> <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/n/nolasri01.shtml">Nolasco</a> had a good season. Sure there are some subtle differences between the two sites, and even how they end up rating a player. But this isn’t about exact sciences at this point. It’s more about making data prevalent. A big shout out goes to <a href="https://twitter.com/hififidelity">Nic English</a> and his crew for getting this out there. Job well&nbsp;done.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/prediction-versus-explanation/">Prediction versus Explanation</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>There is a subtle, yet very important, distinction between explanation and prediction in most sports, and Major League Soccer is no different. I don’t intend to make this long or particularly math heavy, so hang on. Here’s a simple example of what I’m talking about when I refer to <strong><em>explanation</em></strong>. In its first six games of the season, the Portland Timbers recorded 89 attempts and allowed just 57 to their opponents. <strong><em>During that same time</em></strong>, Portland scored ten goals while allowing eight. I might <strong><em>explain</em></strong> that the Timbers’ +2 goal differential was due—at least in part—to earning more offensive opportunities than their opponents. Here’s another example, but this time in regards to <strong><em>prediction</em></strong>. In their first six games, the New England Revolution scored two goals while allowing six to its opponents. <strong><em>During its next six games</em></strong>, New England scored eight goals while allowing just three to its opponents. Using just New England as an example, it would seem as though goal scoring in the past (-4) poorly <strong><em>predicted</em></strong> goal scoring in the future (+5).  Of course, we have nineteen teams, not two, so I sorted through all nineteen teams looking for patterns. Here is what I found. A team’s goal differential during its first six games <strong><em>explained</em></strong> its total points over that same time period extremely well (R2 was 77%). This is not surprising. Teams that tend to score more goals than their opponents also tend to win more games. Nothing shocking there. However, a team’s goal differential in the first six games of the season provided no help in <strong><em>predicting</em></strong> its total points over the next six games. Here’s the plot on that&nbsp;one: </p>
<p><img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/gd-vs-future-points-6-weeks-2013.jpeg" alt="GD vs. Future Points - 6 weeks 2013"></p>
<p>There is virtually no relationship between how well a team scored before, and then how many points it earned later. In other words, goal differentials are not predictive over six games. But if you’re convinced the lack of predictive ability is completely due to a small sample size of twelve total games, check this out. A team’s attempts differential in its first six games shows a statistically significant correlation to both its future goal differential and points earned: <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ad-vs-gd-and-ad-vs-pts.jpg" alt="AD vs. GD and AD vs. Pts">   Because it’s sports, prediction is never going to be precise, and these aren’t perfect correlations at all. But I find it particularly impressive that over just twelve total games, the attempts data from a team’s first six games shows statistically significant predictive ability of the team’s results in the next six games. If you’ve listened to our Game-of-the-Week section during our podcasts, you hear us talking a lot about shot ratios. This post hopefully clarified why we do that. Past shot ratios are better than past results at predicting future&nbsp;results.</p>
