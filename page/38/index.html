            <h2><a href="/articles/finding-numbers-whoscored-and-their-expanding-american-statistics/">Finding Numbers: WhoScored And Their Expanding American Statistics</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I’ve stated that one of the goals for this site is the production of numbers, but also generally using them as book markers to bits of information. I haven’t been too good about this second part but I’m going to try to get better. One thing that was pointed out to me this last week (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/sternbc">Brian Stern</a>) was that <a href="http://www.whoscored.com/Regions/233/Tournaments/85/USA-Major-League-Soccer">WhoScored </a>has at long last increased the information that they provide on <span class="caps">MLS</span>. We’ve had a link to WhoScored for sometime but generally speaking they haven’t been very good about keeping the information updated, keeping it accurate or producing anything worth visiting it on a consistent basis. But the fact that they have some basic visuals and do have good content for most of the rest of the world makes it a worthy site. There was also the hope that they would finally find the time to spend on the American-based league. Well, now they have and it’s pretty awesome. For instance; if I wanted to know who averages the most passes for the San Jose Earthquakes, I could go in real quickly and see that <strong>Sam Cronin</strong> averages 45.2 passes per game, almost a whole 8 above the trailer <strong>Ramiro Corrales</strong> (37.9), and that Cronin has completed 475 of 633 passes. The only thing at this point in time that could be better is for it to give a spray chart of where he likes to pass and to whom. I could see that, according to the stats, Philadelphia has yet to score purely on a counter attack and seems to favor carrying the ball down the right side of the pitch, as they use that side 37% of the time. Alternatively we can see that <span class="caps">DC</span> United has taken 65% of its shots from the middle of the pitch. But mostly what it does is it allows us to do is put things in context. Is it unusual that Houston attempts short passes 80% of the time, or is that normal? Well I can see that DC United and the Columbus Crew make short passes at 78%, but short passes make up 82% of the Montreal Impact’s pass attempts. There isn’t a wrong or right amount of short passes, but it does help us understand the specific influence of the style and attack. You may or may not have already seen WhoScored and you may or may not have seen that they updated their American side site. That’s cool. This is for those that didn’t hear. We’re trying to make it easier for people to conduct their own analysis and do so in the most educated way possible. As a side note it looks like they further plan to expand the information they provide on the US Leagues as they have NASL section dated later on this year, probably anticipated for the second half of their season. That could further help us when attempting to gather information on some of the US Open Cup teams and some of the lesser known players who don’t have an opportunity to have their name&nbsp;shine.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>Welcome, to American Soccer Analysis. After a week off we pick up today with an episode about various soccer events over the course of the past week, Western Conference standings, and our traditional Review/Preview of the <span class="caps">LA</span> Galaxy drumming of Seattle, and then tonight’s game with Sporting facing off at home against Montreal. All this during an episode in which Drew heads to his hallway in search of a better connection to his internet, when all it really needed was a hug.

            <h2><a href="/articles/los-angeles-galaxy-seattle-sounders/">GAME OF THE WEEK: Los Angeles VS. Seattle</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Since the weekend was filled with barbecues, families, and time away from the pseudo grind of the world, we decided to skip out on our weekly podcast. But we all love our “Game of the Week” contest so much that we decided to still preview tonight’s game of the week between Seattle and <span class="caps">LA</span>. This is what we do for you, America. This is our service.  <strong><span class="caps">DREW</span>:</strong> The <span class="caps">LA</span> Galaxy are playing a soccer game? ESPN, you know what to do… broadcast it at a time when everyone East of Utah will be asleep! After last week’s Galaxy v Red Bulls snoozefest took 89 minutes for anything to happen, ESPN has decided to go double or nothing and show the slumping Galaxy against a Seattle team on a roll. It has largely been because <strong>Lamar Neagle</strong> (no, seriously) has either found out how to use those <a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5284/5370026525_6eea3e1138_b.jpg">neon jerseys</a> to blind defenders, or finally decided he’s an <span class="caps">MLS</span> quality striker. After Seattle started the season unable to score goals, the Sounders are now getting them in bunches. Or as I like to put it: they’re regressing to the mean with a&nbsp;vengeance! </p>
<p>As for the Galaxy, their dependence on <strong>Juninho</strong> was exposed last week after a hard tackle from his namesake forced him to leave the game early. Los Angeles never got back into sync with him off the field, and New York dominated the rest of the game. As of this writing, his status is still up in the air, but If the Galaxy are going to keep <strong>Ozzie Alonso</strong> in check they’ll need <strong>Juninho</strong> to keep him occupied. Should Garcia (or anyone else) get the start in Juninho’s place, then Alonso will get more forward than he otherwise would, freeing up Neagle, Martins, and family to attack the net. Couple that with the fact that <strong>Carlo Cudicini</strong> has looked as good in goal this season as <strong>Jimmy Nielsen</strong> looks in <a href="https://twitter.com/SportingKC/status/337244634994601984">jorts</a>, and the Galaxy could be in for a&nbsp;hurtin’.</p>
<p>All that said, the Galaxy have been very solid at home this season, and the Fishing Village to the North have found their scoring touch at home, but still struggle to get goals on the road. My prediction: if Juninho plays, the Galaxy will pull this out 2-1. If not, it will be a 1-1&nbsp;draw.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">MATTHIAS</span>:</strong></p>
<p>The Sounders have come on strong recently, recording 13 points in their last five matches. I checked for a recent dip in Seattle’s strength of schedule, but there was no such dip to be found. Seattle has played three of those last five matches on the road, including a win on the road in Kansas City and a win at home over&nbsp;Dallas.</p>
<p>The Sounders’ win at Colorado shouldn’t be overlooked either. I will be coming out with a strength of schedule index soon, but my beta version* suggests that the Rapids have played the toughest schedule to this point (along with New England). That’s not to mention that, as the away team, Seattle was giving up an estimated third-of-a-goal in an uphill battle. Impressive&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<p>But after saying all those wonderful things about Seattle, <strong><em>my three points this week go to the Galaxy in a one-goal victory.</em></strong> Though the Sounders find themselves second in the tables in goal differential, they are second to the Galaxy. Though the Sounders have an impressive 1.21 Shots-on-goal Ratio, the Galaxy have outdone them again at 1.37. Though the Sounders’ strength of schedule has been difficult recently, over the course of the season it’s the Galaxy that have faced seemingly tougher opponents. The final nail in the coffin is that the game will be played in Los Angeles, and that third-of-a-goal advantage will lie with the Galaxy. <span class="caps">LA</span> drew more than 20,000 fans to its last home match on May 5<span class="ord">th</span>, and you can bet they’ll show up for the red hot&nbsp;Sounders.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>*Strength of schedule is currently based on opponents’ goal differentials and shots-on-goal&nbsp;ratios.</em></p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">HARRISON</span>:</strong></p>
<p>I write a lot about the Sounders over the course of the week so let me make this simple. They were taking shots; at first they weren’t going in and then, recently, they started all going in. Somewhere in between these two truths lies the median of this organization. They aren’t as good or as lucky as what they’ve been in cumulatively over the past 2 1/2 weeks. But they certainly weren’t as bad as what they were to start the season. It’s a bit difficult to gauge the true talent level of this squad because of how frequent these parts are moving&nbsp;about.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for the Sounders, <strong>Ozzie Alonso </strong>is <a href="http://blog.thenewstribune.com/soccer/2013/05/21/sounders-roster-remains-fluid-due-to-call-in-injuries/">suffering from a groin strain</a> that will probably prevent him from making an appearance and <strong>Steve Zakuani</strong> is still not able to go this weekend. Which will force the Sounders to work with an inopportune 18 and even a less-conducive starting <span class="caps">XI</span>. This isn’t something new to them this year, but I imagine that it’s still going to be tough for them to deal with due to how Los Angeles works the ball through the middle of the field with <strong>Marcelo&nbsp;Sarvas.</strong></p>
<p>However, the Galaxy are also dealing with injuries to their central midfield—-specifically with Juninho who, as Drew mentioned above, was taken out ironically enough by a rough tackle from New York’s opposing Juninho. Los Angeles uses an assortment of means to move the ball up the pitch. They average more shots than their opponents, more possessions and longer ones by the <a href="http://tempofreesoccer.blogspot.com/2013/03/2013-mls-tempo-free-table.html">standard of <span class="caps">TFS</span>.</a> Despite that, they’ve managed an impressive 17 points in 11 games and are still considered one of the more unlucky teams in all the&nbsp;league.</p>
<p>Adding to their attack the athletic <strong>Robbie Rogers</strong> and a <strong>Landon Donovan—-</strong>who has something to prove to Jurgen Klinsmann—-and all of a sudden you have a club that is very dangerous and probably one of the better ones in the league. Add that to the likelihood of the Sounders shot-to-goal ratio coming back to earth and the absence of Ozzie Alonso, and you end up with a very likely Galaxy win at home. I don’t think it’s going to be anywhere a long the lines of the Sounders defeat from the playoffs, but a 2-1 victory wouldn’t surprise&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>-—-</p>
<p><strong>Current Standings (as best as I can remember&nbsp;them):</strong></p>
<p>Drew 0 - 3 ; Prediction: <span class="caps">LA</span> (if Juninho&nbsp;plays)</p>
<p>Matthias 2 - 3 ; Prediction:&nbsp;<span class="caps">LA</span></p>
<p>Harrison 1 - 4 ; Prediction:&nbsp;<span class="caps">LA</span></p>
