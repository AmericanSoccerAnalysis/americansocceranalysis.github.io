            <h2><a href="/articles/dc-united-and-waiting-until-next-year-2/">D.C. United and Waiting Until Next Year</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>“Wait until next year” is about to become the mantra for 9 clubs as the <span class="caps">MLS</span> playoffs will be kicking off soon. It will leave those clubs behind, along with two more after the play-in round between the 4 <span class="amp">&amp;</span> 5 seeds from the East and West, respectively. <span class="caps">DC</span> United, despite their US Open Cup victory, are the first of these nine to consider life after the season. With their lack of success this season, much of the discussion following their Open Cup win has been about how good they can be next year, regardless of what they did this season. This seems like a good question, but I decided to open it up a bit. How good have teams been following a season with a bottom-3 finish in the table? <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/last3finish1.png" alt="Last3Finish">One thing that easily catches one’s eye is that there are some repeats on here, which brings sustainability into question, but that’s a question for another day. What is important to me now is how massive 8 points is when you are talking about a table that is rich in parity. Bottom dwellers tended to perform about 8 points better in the tables the following season. Right now, 8 points separates the Chicago Fire from being out of the playoffs with a bottom-three finish in the Eastern Conference and a second-place finish. 8 points means a lot! While 8 points isn’t enough to completely change the fortunes <span class="caps">DCU</span> this off-season, it’s reasonable to expect a better-than-8-point improvement, due to some obvious roster turnover, health being restored to key figures in their best XI, and some added cap flexibility. You can point back to the 2009 New York Red Bulls or even the 2010 Philadelphia Union who both made substantial changes to put them in the playoff picture. Bottom line: if you think that D.C. United will be terrible next year because they were terrible this year, then you are wrong and getting ahead of&nbsp;yourself.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/champions-league-how-much-is-it-worth-to-an-mls-club/">Champions League: How Much is it Worth to an MLS Club?</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>The major talking point concerning the <span class="caps">CONCACAF</span> Champions League, and gaining entry into the tournament, is the payroll increase that MLS affords a club that qualifies. Now, this isn’t the sizable increase for a club that we see for a team in Europe, but it has the potential to be a game-changer in MLS, depending on the team and its ownership. Most figures concerning team salary/payroll are generally guarded for obvious reasons. However, rather than using official numbers, I went through the data generously provided by the <a href="http://www.mlsplayers.org/salary_info.html">Players Union</a> and calculated the accrued difference in pay between when the team won entry and the following year after the increase. Now, as it happens, the Union only has data posted as far back as 2007, that’s okay. Since the tournament underwent changes, adapting to it’s current format back in 2008. [caption id=”attachment_730” align=”aligncenter” width=”401”]<img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/championsleagueincrease.png" alt="ChampionsLeagueIncrease"> Figures above in millions of American dollars.[/caption] Obviously, this is still a small sample size, but it gives you a rough figure on how this could help <span class="caps">DC</span> United and the other Champion-League-bound clubs this season.  A big caveat to using the Unions’ data is that its just a snap shot at a given point in the season. Not necessarily what they paid out in dues for the entire campaign. An obvious tip-off to that is Seattle dropping payroll from 2009 to 2010. They didn’t cut funds, but because late in the season they traded away Freddie Ljungberg to Chicago, his cost was associated with their club despite Seattle playing the majority of his contract for the season. This is just one example among 20 unique situations. No season is the same. The LA Galaxy and their 16% cut in 2011 largely came from David Beckham’s greatly reduced fee. 2013 comes and that fee is entirely off the book with his trip to PSG and the Galaxy not replacing his huge contract with another high paid designated player. Instead they signed Omar Gonzalez. Still a team gaining access to the Champions League enjoys a nice 9% raise in their annual spending, and as is the case in other leagues, dollars spent correlate to points and position in the table to some&nbsp;degree.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/mls-playoff-chances/">MLS Playoff Chances</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>We are now including playoffs and Supporters’ Shield probabilities on <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/">our <span class="caps">MLS</span> Tables</a>, if you were unaware. These chances are calculated based on each team’s current points and remaining schedule. The remaining game-by-game probabilities are specifically generated from the&nbsp;following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Which team is playing at home. Home teams have won nearly 50% of all <span class="caps">MLS</span> matches during the last three seasons. There is definitely an advantage to having a remaining schedule packed with home&nbsp;matches. </li>
<li>Total attempts generated and conceded. All season I have been studying the best predictive measures, and all season it’s been&nbsp;<span class="caps">SHOTS</span>.</li>
<li>Finishing rates for and against. Though finishing rates weren’t very predictive at the season’s midpoint, it turns out they’re not completely worthless after at least 25&nbsp;games.</li>
<li>Past strength of schedule, as measured by past opponents’ attempts&nbsp;data.</li>
<li>Other variables, such as past possession percentage, were considered, but they did not help predict the outcome of the game better than those chosen above.
The above indicators were tested on the last 10 week’s worth of games during the 2011, 2012 and 2013 seasons (well, up through the most recent week). Using a multinomial regression, I was able to calculate the influence of each indicator, and then the resulting probabilities of each of the three possible outcomes (home win, draw, away win). Once these probabilities were established, it was a matter of simulation. My simulation was based on the game-by-game probabilities (above), and I let the computer simulate the games as though they were weighted coin flips (like how your <span class="caps">PS3</span> simulates Fifa or Madden games) over and over again. So basically, I simulated the last 36 games of the season 10,000 times each, added up the total points for each team, and created 10,000 simulated tables. The POFF% probabilities is simply the proportion of times that each team earned a “clean” playoff berth—-that is, ties for fifth were not included. The Shield% probability represents the proportion of times each team earned at least a share of the top position in MLS. As an example, Portland made the playoffs 9,919 times out of the 10,000 simulated seasons, seeing its simulated probability of making the playoffs go up about 4.7% from last week after a win against the Galaxy. What might surprise you a little is that the Timbers have a very real chance (16.3%) at the Supporters’ Shield, according to this model. That’s up about 10% from last week. To try to understand why Portland received such a favorable jump, consider that just about every possible thing that could have helped the Timbers’ chances happened. Portland earned 3 points against a team that the model thought was pretty good (the Galaxy), Seattle and New York tied—-the best possible outcome from Portland’s perspective—-and Sporting KC lost in a pretty big upset. Though RSL still won, that doesn’t matter too much because Portland gets RSL at home, and that match will be the one that most likely determines a points winner between the two teams. Also consider that Portland has a home match against Seattle coming up. Because the model gives big boosts to home teams, the Timbers have a reasonable chance for 6-point swings against RSL and Seattle. Oh, and there’s that away match at Chivas to end the season. The model thinks Portland will take three points in that one with about 50% probability,<em> which is quite high for any away team. There is still a lot of fight left in the Eastern Conference playoff push, as four teams have less than 60% probability of making the playoffs. In the West, things are a little more straightforward, though San Jose has been sneaky of late, and it could potentially steal Colorado’s playoff spot. The model seems to like the Galaxy’s talent and schedule more than Colorado, enough to put the Rapids on the Western Conference’s hot seat. _</em>That might seem low, but consider that Chivas has 5 wins, 7 losses and 4 draws at home this season. That means they have only lost 7/16 games at home, or about 44%. Portland’s 50.3% makes more sense in that&nbsp;context._</li>

            <h2><a href="/articles/sporting-kansas-city-kei-kamara/">How Much Difference Did Kei Kamara Make To Sporting Kansas City?</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I spent some time this week riding a few planes and doing my cross-country travel thing with the family. That means a lot of distractions, which in turn leads to time reading nerdy books and listening to podcasts. I’m not sure if it was just that the Sporting <span class="caps">KC</span> machine was on full crisis mode or what. I happened to catch 4 different podcasts (including <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/09/19/analysis-evolved-podcast-episode-xxii-a-treatise-on-podcasting-casual-wear-rbny-and-the-mls-playoffs/">our own</a>…btw what a job Drew <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Matty did without me, huh? Proves I’m expendable…)  talking about Sporting and their lack of ability to facilitate a goal in the Champions League at home. Obviously that’s a big deal, in part because they look to be one of the teams that will proceed on to the quarter finals next spring and continue to represent <span class="caps">MLS</span>. But despite them sitting pretty in the CCL and third (using points per game) in the table for the Supporter Shield, a couple of podcasts basically forecasted that they would fall a part without a “proven scorer” now that <strong>Kei Kamara</strong> has departed. Now, I have to say that I’ve been mildly impressed with them as a team, and their pack of forwards—-featuring <strong>Claudio Bieler</strong>, <strong>Soony Saad</strong>, <strong><span class="caps">CJ</span> Sapong</strong> and the recently returned <strong>Dominic Dwyer—-</strong>make for an interesting four-some. That isn’t including <strong>Teal Bunbury</strong> who made his <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2013/06/12/4289888/teal-bunbury-makes-his-return.html">return to the club after being out for a year-long rehab with a torn <span class="caps">ACL</span></a>. My immediate reaction two weeks ago was to question the transfer the deadline deal and transfer of Kamara three weeks ago. I spent a day putting some thoughts together and then second-guessed myself that I was maybe naive. They’ve got quite a few weapons, and the added play of <strong>Benny Feilhaber—-</strong>who admittedly I’ve never been a fan of—-stepping into the void left by the departure of a six-foot, three-inch winger from Sierra Leone has been big. Their string of results (9 points in 3 games) made me think I was being silly. Then today, while on the road from Atlanta, a thought crossed my mind and I decided that I would take a closer look at the numbers. I collected shot data for the matches Kamara participated in (and to the minute he was subbed in) as well as the games Sporting played without him, and I built myself a nifty little spreadsheet. Now, before I throw these numbers at you, there is the need for a little asterisk to all this work. I’m sure it’s already understood, but if not, let me make it clear: these numbers are very vague and there is still quiet a bit of noise involved. How much, I’m not sure. It’s just important to recognize the difficulty of trying to measure what a team does with and without a single player, and extract the difference. I would love to quantify everything, but <em>everything</em> is currently unavailable. This is a very simple method in a very small sample size of a context. To the numbers! With Kei&nbsp;Kamara… </p>
<p>Total Minutes&nbsp;1026</p>
<p><span class="caps">SHOT</span> RATIO&nbsp;2.171</p>
<p><span class="caps">KP</span> RATIO&nbsp;1.940</p>
<p>Goals per 90&nbsp;1.930</p>
<p>Goals Allowed per 90&nbsp;1.316</p>
<p>Points Per Match
1.67
And then again… only without&nbsp;him. </p>
<p>without&nbsp;Kamara</p>
<p>Total Minutes&nbsp;1584</p>
<p><span class="caps">SHOT</span> RATIO&nbsp;1.527</p>
<p><span class="caps">KP</span> RATIO&nbsp;1.793</p>
<p>Goals per 90&nbsp;1.193</p>
<p>Goals Allowed per 90&nbsp;0.739</p>
<p>Points Per Match
1.63
You can see pretty the numbers plainly that the are overwhelmingly in the favor of Sporting being a better team with Kamara. And I don’t think anyone would argue against it. However, the difference between the two teams should be questioned as it’s possible the numbers are a result of the different system in which coach <strong>Peter Vermes</strong> implements with Kamara opposed to how he configures the team without his former star forward. I think the big stat that stands out to me is the number of goals allowed per 90 without Kamara in the starting <span class="caps">XI</span>. Which is pretty crazy, considering that the club actually surrenders less shots with Kamara in the line-up: <em><strong>6.7 with vs. 7.4 without.</strong></em> This is what leads me to believe that A) the team plays a different style without him and B) that it may not be sustainable. I wasn’t on the crazy train with thinking that Sporting has all these problems and is going to eventually fall apart. I’m still cautious enough that I’m still waiting to see if they’ll make a move towards the Supporters Shield with their remaining 5 matches in the season. Their shot ratio, even without Kamara, would still be best in all of <span class="caps">MLS</span>. So it’s hard to simply throw crazy statements that this team is that much worse without him. The bigger issue at hand for me is that Sporting was a force with Kamara. Without him, they’re simply another good team in league filled with good teams. Both are sets of clubs (with and without Kamara) that are capable of winning silverware. That said, this really leads you to question why Vermes would sell off such a significant difference-maker overseas with a real shot at making a run for multiple cups at this point in the&nbsp;season.</p>
