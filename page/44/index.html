I have no idea why I’m up besides the fact that I don’t have to go to work in the morning. But with the upswing of free time, I’m just corralling the internet and generally reviewing information that I often don’t find time to cruise through. While sifting through data and spending my time nodding off to sleep at my key board, I came across <a href="http://www.optasports.com/en/playground-section.aspx">Opta’s playground</a> site where they are “opening up the database”. I’m not sure how new this is or if it is just something I missed. But I know it wasn’t available the last time I was around. It’s a basic request for <del>people</del> nerds like me (and possibly you…) to submit data requests. An understatement would be to call this development “cool”. A lot of data within Soccer is closed off and generally leaves a lot to be desired. Being a guy that used to write a lot about baseball, it would be awful—strickly speaking from my perspective—to write about a player if the lack of overall information that was provide is akin to that of modern day soccer data. It’s safeguarded and looked after as if it was top secret defense information. To be fair, I actually think that some of that information is kept more secure than defense information. But that’s not really the subject. Having the ability to submit an e-mail request for specific data is exciting. It’s a marked improved over the current status-que. Sure, you could complain about the fact that they only accept one application in all categories per e-mail address, but who cares it’s an improvement and here, that’s what we’re all&nbsp;about.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>We talk and we talk about the need for more information to solve some of the problems and general questions that we have as a collective community within Soccer Analytics. Today I ran across a general post about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2013/apr/25/forget-big-data-small-data-revolution">Big Data and the revolution that is really small data</a>. It lead me back to thinking about some of the discussions that Matthias (apparently he has a real name), Keith (the missing guy in the podcasts), and I have had prior and outside of the podcasting realms. It’s not always about waiting to develop thoughts or theories until you have data, but making do with what you have at your current disposal and developing theories that later—with further advances—you can prove or&nbsp;disprove. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as we now find it ludicrous to talk of “big software” – as if size in itself were a measure of value – we should, and will one day, find it equally odd to talk of “big data”. Size in itself doesn’t matter – what matters is having the data, of whatever size, that helps us solve a problem or address the question we have.  - <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2013/apr/25/forget-big-data-small-data-revolution">Rufus&nbsp;Pollock</a></p>

<p>I’m not saying that anyone is or is not doing this… it just seemed really profound after a cup a coffee and two shots of espresso, that I thought I’d mention&nbsp;it.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>Hello, there, you fine traveller… if you are of a west coast bias you’ll love today’s show. First I have to say I’m really sadden by the fact that neither myself nor Matty worked in a “Third” joke with as much as we like to talk about cutting the field into thirds with this being our third podcast. <em>sigh</em> it didn’t happen, maybe we’ll save the jokes for episode 33. Anyways… we have the following for you. - We chronicle the life and times of your’s truly, me, Harrison Crow, and little background as to why I created the site - We talk a bit about possession stats, why they’re important, why they are not and how they are sometimes misleading. I referenced a <a href="http://www.optasportspro.com/en/about/optapro-blog/posts/2012/possession%28s%29.aspx">blog post by Opta</a> during this conversation… please take a look it has a lot of really good information. I’m trying to come up with a bunch of material for a post later on today. I hope you all check it out. - We do mention Montreal and their Italian influenced defense/counter-attack system and how it’s helped them to a 2<span class="ord">nd</span> place start in the Eastern Conference - Next, we chronicle the poor start to the Sounders and why their possession stats are so high, yet have produced no goals. We also mention a bit about Sporting Kansas City and the <span class="caps">LA</span> Galaxy, as well as the Portland Timbers and their dominance in possession. - We use the segue of the Portland Timbers to talk a little bit about Will Johnson…underrated pick-up, amazing goals, and his ability to troll on Alan Gordon. Yep, he’s gone for 3 games. Gordon, not Johnson… <img src="http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BH3q2uOCcAAYBNy.png" alt=""> And for those of you who didn’t catch his brilliant goal, at home, which in turn gave the Timbers 3-points, check it out below: [youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHMV-zPqccc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHMV-zPqccc</a>] - Lastly we talked about our “game-of-the-week” which we selected Sporting Kansas City and Los Angeles Galaxy. While separated by 7 points in the table—and more specifically 2 games in hand by <span class="caps">LA</span>—-Tempo-Free Soccer has them ranked 1 and 2. We make our picks for who we like, why, and a few little facts to back it up. This podcast is a bit longer than usual at 45 mins, I hope you enjoy!
