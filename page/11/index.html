          <section class="content"><p>After a short discussion on twitter here, is the record of the <span class="caps">LA</span> Galaxy with <strong>Jaime Penedo</strong> and then again without him. It’s an extremely small sample size (7 games with vs. 25 without), and so you have to, of course, approach it with a sense of&nbsp;skepticism. </p>

How good are they? Are they an <span class="caps">MLS</span> Cup contender? Well… I generally believe once you get to the playoffs you’re a contender regardless. But the question still remains, can the Galaxy still be a team that wins silverware? Maybe, maybe not. It’s really hard to judge at this point. For what it’s worth, I think it’s clear that they are a much better team with him than without. Small sample sizes leave me with only my eyes. Also, I still think they made a mistake signing <strong>Omar Gonzalez</strong> to <span class="caps">DP</span> contract. I guess that’s another can of&nbsp;worms.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/game-of-the-week-seattle-at-portland/">Game of the Week: Seattle at Portland</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p><em>We spent a fair amount of time talking about this match on <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/10/11/asa-podcast-xxv-the-one-where-we-go-full-west-coast-mostly/">Thursday night’s podcast</a> if you are interested in that sort of thing.</em> Coming into this match, form might be one of the most discussed topics. Seattle has earned just two points in its last four games, while Portland has earned eight points over that same span. In my opinion, form only means something if there’s an obvious reason as to its recent fluctuation. For Seattle, there is no obvious reason for its poor play. Seattle has been bad the last four matches in terms of results, but they have actually outshot those opponents 56-to-41. The real effect on form this game will likely be the fact that Brad Evans and Eddie Johnson are out due to international duty—-technically, though in Johnson’s case it’s more <a href="http://blogs.seattletimes.com/soundersfc/2013/10/10/eddie-johnson-suffers-groin-injury-with-usmnt-taken-off-roster-for-world-cup-qualifiers/">his injury</a> that’s going to keep him out. The Timbers will be without Rodney Wallace, Ryan Johnson and Alvas Powell. However, the Timbers’ Johnson is not nearly the potential threat as that of the Sounders, and Powell has been in a reserve role since the return of Jack Jewsbury and Futty Danso. The absences seem to favor the Timbers. The stats suggest that Portland is a somewhat heavy favorite this match. Playing in front of Jeldwen’s home fans, with better shot rates and finishing rates on the season, our model suggests the Timbers have a 52-percent probability of winning against the Sounders’ 19 percent. This really shouldn’t be surprising, as we’ve seen the strong predictive ability of both home-field advantage and shots rates. What might be slightly more surprising is the effect of this match on the Supporters’ Shield race. In the event of a Portland win, our season simulation suggests Portland would catapult to nearly a 45-percent chance at (at least a share of) the Shield, and Seattle would fall to below five percent (2.3%). However, if Seattle pulls off the upset, it would improve its chances to 26 percent, while simultaneously dropping Portland to virtually zero percent. A tie would actually be the <em>combined</em> worst-case scenario for the two teams. They currently share 38-percent chances at the overall top seed, but a tie would leave the Sounders at 12.4 percent and the Timbers with 0.3 percent, allowing New York (45.3%) and Sporting Kansas City (42.8%) to fight over the Shield. These two teams are almost sure to make the playoffs, regardless of tonight’s outcome. But a top-seed and the prospect of home-field advantage in a potential <span class="caps">MLS</span> Cup Final no doubt elicits some drooling from both sets of&nbsp;supporters.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>I’m not really going to apologize for the biased topics. It’s very heavy Timbers/Sounders, which corresponds with the teams that we support, and we kind of neglect all else. The thing is this: despite there being 17 other teams in the league, this derby could also influence a lot of what’s going to happen to the rest of the Western&nbsp;Conference.</p>
<p>Obviously, that isn’t the whole narrative to the <span class="caps">MLS</span> playoffs, considering that there three-to-four clubs that could possibly swap in or out of the playoffs in the East. However, there just seemed to be a huge story line here to us, as well as some interesting numbers that correspond to it, which is why Timbers/Sounders became this week’s&nbsp;theme.</p>
<p>Next week we’ll return to taking a look at the rest of the league…mostly. I mean, I’m sure Sunday night’s game will come up, but there are other things to be mentioned and you’ll hear less of our bias. But, as it has been mentioned previously, bias accounts for a lot when dealing with numbers, and it only seems appropriate that it would also be present in what we do in regards to our&nbsp;podcast.</p>
<p>Oh, well. Here it is, and I hope you like&nbsp;it.</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>The last 12 months have been rather eventful for the North American Soccer League (<span class="caps">NASL</span>). A league that once folded before some of us were born has begun to become some what relevant again. Even putting aside the excitement surrounding the return of the New York Cosmos to professional soccer—-a team that is surrounded and entrenched in US Soccer history—-one sees how well the league fared against some of the MLS clubs. NASL knocked out two of the big dogs in the LA Galaxy (2-0, Carolina RailHawks) and Seattle Sounders FC (1-0, Tampa Bay Rowdies) this past year. Add that to the expansion plans of the league outside of New York. This past year they’ve added Indianapolis, Jacksonville and Oklahoma City to their growing portfolio. These were shrewd moves to get toe holds in two cities that have limited professional sports and strengthen their ties in Florida, what with three soccer cities in South Florida and four in the Southeastern region. The league is obviously poised for a positive return. Living in Tampa for the next few months, I plan on taking in at least one match (this weekend in their Derby game vs. Fort Lauderdale) and checking out the scene. Okay, there is the narrative. Let’s take a look at the table and some&nbsp;numbers: </p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Since we now have playoff and Supporters’ Shield chances on the site, it provides us with a means of weighting each upcoming game by its effect on playoff odds. What if, for instance, Montreal were to lose to New England at home this weekend? There’s no doubt it would hurt Montreal and keep New England alive, but just how much would it matter? The same question can be asked of the San Jose and Colorado, who play tonight. Currently, <strong><a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/">our model</a></strong> gives Colorado and Montreal 90.4 and 82.8 percent chances,<em> respectively, to make the playoffs, while San Jose and New England sit at 6.0 and 14.1 percent. Remember that our playoff chances refer to earning at least fifth place in the conference, and they do not include probability associated with ties for fifth. I re-ran our simulations three times, accounting for the three possible conclusions to each of those games. I allowed the simulator to pick winners as usual for the other matches this week and beyond. To the results! A San Jose tie or loss at home tonight would effectively end its chances of a playoff berth. In just 11 of the 10,000 simulated seasons (0.11%) did San Jose recover from a loss to claim a playoff spot (not counting ties for fifth), and even a tie only doubled those chances to about 0.23 percent. A win boosted its playoff chances from 6.0 to 12.0 percent. Playoffs would still not be likely for the Earthquakes, but at least a win tonight would give them something to play for in the final two games. Their opponent, Colorado, is the West’s most likely team to give up its playoff spot, according to our model. That said, its playoff chances are still quite high. Even a loss to San Jose tonight would only lower the Rapids’ playoff chances to about 78.4 percent. A tie or win for Colorado tonight essentially assures it a tie-breaker-free route to the playoffs with at least 98.7 percent probability (99.9% with a win tonight). Moving over to the East, the game most likely to swing playoff percentage points around is the Montreal—-New England matchup. New England could increase its playoff chances from 14.1 to nearly 39 percent with a road win. However, like San Jose, a tie or loss would hurt New England a lot. A tie would leave New England with only about a 5.6 percent shot at the playoffs, and a loss would render the Revs’ situation quite hopeless at 1.6 percent. Conversely, a win or tie for the Montreal Impact would have a mirrored result, boosting its playoff chances to 91.0 percent with a tie and 99.2 percent with win against the Revs. Like Colorado, a loss would not ruin Montreal, and their playoff chances would sit right around 63.3 percent. A lot of playoff probability is waiting to swing—-as much as 12 percent in San Jose’s case and 38 percent in New England’s case. In my opinion, this speaks as much to the weight resting on these final few weeks as it does to the weight that was on the games that led us to this point. Teams like Colorado and Montreal have performed well enough in the first 30 or 31 games to put themselves in a position where a loss still leaves them with better than 50 percent chances at a playoff spot. Oh, in case your were curious, our model gives San Jose a 39-percent shot at a win tonight, 31-percent chances of a loss, and 30-percent chances of a tie. As for New England, those probabilities are 29 percent, 39 percent and 32 percent. _</em>The margins of error for 95% confidence are, at most, 1.0 percent for each playoff percentage&nbsp;calculation._</p>

<p>This was a long one folks; the running time is roughly 75 minutes. We usually try to keep everything around an hour, but it’s been a while since all three of us were together. There may have been some moments we got a little excited and went longer than normal. This week’s first segment was an ode to <strong>Ben Olsen</strong> and the<strong> <span class="caps">DC</span> United</strong> game plan that not only produced a win on the road against a very tough opponent, but also won them the <span class="caps">US</span> Open Cup and a bid to the CONCACAF Champions League. Because the first segment went a bit long we used the second segment to cover the usual past week of matches, with emphasis on the following games: Sporting-Philly, New England-Houston, LA-Portland and Seattle-New York, all of which had significant impacts on the playoff outlook. The last segment saw us go into a bit of detail about Sporting Kansas City and a possible run at the MLS Cup. In our language, possible doesn’t always mean probable, but in this case it just might. There is also a the a spot where I completely butcher Matthias’ twitter handle, and I may have also made up a some words in there, too, only to have Drew coyly call me on it. All in all, this was was an especially fun episode to record, and I hope that you all enjoy it!
