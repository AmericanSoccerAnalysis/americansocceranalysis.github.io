          <section class="content"><p>It is true that Sporting has had trouble getting points at home. <span class="caps">SKC</span> earned 30 points at Sporting Park this year, good for 13<span class="ord">th</span> in a league of 19 teams. Based on that information alone, some will argue that Sporting is not a good home team. One of those people is Simon Borg, who <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/video/2013/12/05/sporting-kc-mls-cup-favorite-over-real-salt-lake-playoff-central">justifies his viewpoint</a> by pointing out that <span class="caps">SKC</span> lost five times at home, as though that matters. It doesn’t. I’ve shown that <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/08/12/signal-and-noise-in-mls/">past points simply don’t correlate well to future points</a>. With information like shot ratios and expected goal differentials (xGD), points are essentially a meaningless indicator of team ability—-or at the very least, a meaningless <strong>predictor</strong>. I see “predictor” and “indicator” as near-synonyms in this instance, but you may not. Regardless, Sporting’s home points total should not even be considered in the discussion of who will win on Saturday. Why not? In addition to out-shooting its opponents in <strong>every single home game this season</strong>, here is how <span class="caps">SKC</span> did relative to the league in xGD this&nbsp;season: </p>

SKC has a decent goal differential at home, but more importantly, it has the second-best <strong>expected</strong> goal differential at home. xGD is an <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/11/08/the-predictive-power-of-shot-locations-data/">excellent predictor</a> of future success, and a better indication in my mind of true team skill. Borg goes on to talk about the “road warriors” from Salt Lake&nbsp;City: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“They love playing on the road. Playing at home is too much pressure; they do it better when they’re away from&nbsp;home.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>__No team is better on the road than at home, but whatever. <span class="caps">RSL</span> did tie for third in MLS this season with 22 away points earned, but again, we don’t care. RSL out-shot it opponents in just five of 17 road games (29.4%), and, well&nbsp;this: </p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/mls-cup-sporting-kc-vs-real-salt-lake-its-finally-here/">MLS Cup: Sporting KC vs. Real Salt Lake...Its Finally Here</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I wish I could write this long-winded and amazingly-thought-out post. This just won’t be the case. I’m mostly missing the vocabulary to mark the occasion of the biggest match of the American soccer season. Without really prolonging the post or trying to set it up by way of a specific perspective: I was digging around through Squawka and Whoscored data in preparation for tonight’s podcast and found some things that I thought were interesting, and I thought that I would share them with you. <strong>First thought:</strong> Sporting Kansas City pretty much owns the defensive metric counting stats that are available to us, as well as those that I took the time to put together. They rank first in defensive actions recorded, which is simply blocked shots, interceptions and clearances. There isn’t anything that I’ve seen or read that correlates any of these numbers to being a successful team in terms of collecting points. That being said, it’s reasonable to suspect that their ability to prevent shots and produce them at a higher ratio has something to do with these defensive statistics. I personally would associate <span class="caps">SKC</span>’s shot ratios with two specific abilities : their possession—-which we will get in first—-and then prevention. Possession doesn’t tell us whether or not a club is successful, but we have mentioned that it mostly just explains how they going about being successful. Sure, a lot of people take it that when a team is holding onto the ball, that reduces its own opportunities to score. That doesn’t mean that they aren’t reducing their opponents’ opportunities, though. In fact a club that holds on to the ball and makes a lot of successful passes does exactly that. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean they are good at defense or preventing the opposition from generating shots. It just means that they might potentially reduce the number of chances that an opposing team gets. Again, that doesn’t necessarily correlate to earning points, but that does lead to us to the topic of prevention. Sporting is dominant in MLS with intercepting and clearing balls from their attacking third. Controlling possession 58% of the time at home and completing 81% of their passes, they are mitigating opponents’ opportunities, and the same can be said with clearing balls off the backline and preventing the ball from coming into the attacking third at all. Clearing the ball obviously presents the chance that the open play becomes “reset”. That the pressure applied by the opposing attack has to reposition themselves in an manner that would create another chance against the goal. Sometimes that happens quickly sometimes it leads to a turnover in possession. I’d really like to know the percentage of how many times a team got the ball into the final third and then created a shot. I suspect that Sporting Kansas City isn’t necessarily any better than any other team at actually stopping a team from creating chances once they get into the attacking third. Possibly it just limits those entries. However, if a team isn’t getting many opportunities to possess the ball, and their chances of breaking into the attacking third are repelled by clearances, it has to limit the creation of shots. This is my theory on how Sporting KC has produced that positive shot ratio and why their defensive counting stats matter. I don’t really know if any of it actually holds up. <strong>Second Thought:</strong> Real Salt Lake is basically the best litmus test for this theory. A club that has superior passing talent, that also maintains the ability to possess the ball, and doesn’t inadvertently turn it over with the frequency that others do. Again, for like the thousandth time, this doesn’t relate to obtaining points. However, it maybe the specific method they go about for shot creation which does lend itself as predictor. Creating shots is the name of the game, and <span class="caps">RSL</span> is one of the better road teams in MLS who matches up well with SKC in that regard. If SKC’s deterrence method for shots is more about mitigation of possession to specific areas of the pitch which potentially lends itself to preventing shots, then the counter is that RSL is third in away goals from outside the box with 4 converted shots by way of 74 shots. RSL is one of the better teams at converting from distance—-and while that could be as much by the way of luck as it could be by the talent of the line-ups they’ve fielded—-the importance of this is that they aren’t afraid of taking attempts from distance, and that maybe one of the best ways for them to manage a goal against SKC. That leads into this <strong>final thought</strong>: Looking at shots, it’s a duh statement to say that <span class="caps">SKC</span> creates a lot of them. Unfortunately for Real Salt Lake, Sporting creates even more at home than what it normally creates on the road. What is more surprising, though, is that of those shots, the majority come from outside of the 18 yard box. Why would it matter if a team creates more shots from a far than closer to the box? The obvious answer is that it decreases the probability of a goal scoring opportunity. Taking shots is important, regardless of where it’s taken from. Without the shot there is a lack possibility that the ball actually goes into the back of the net…well, unless you are D.C. United and the rest of the league <a href="http://www.bigsoccer.com/community/threads/leading-scorer-own-goal.1994763/">leads your team</a> in goals scored. I certainly approve of most shots because they creates chances. A shot that is parried or even deflected back into a crowd is another chance, a better chance, to score a goal. The problem is when you take a shot you are also conceding possession, as well as position in the attacking third. Better position equates to a higher possibility of a scoring chance and ultimately that’s what your trying to do: increase the odds of scoring a goal. Despite taking 164 shots from outside the box <em><strong>at home</strong></em>, Sporting only scored 5 goals, opposed to 29 goals from 105 shots inside the box. Taking shots from better locations is going to improve your odds, but it’s more than that. It’s about finding the opportunity to win games. Saturday will simply be about finding those moments, finishing them and then, hopefully, winning. Both teams have remarkable similarities and they both possess the ability to expose the others weaknesses. This has the potential to be one of the best <span class="caps">MLS</span> Cups in recent memory. That isn’t to say that LA and Houston pounding on each other hasn’t been somewhat entertaining. But SKC and RSL bring to the table a style of soccer that is pleasing to watch, and each procures shots—-which is one of the biggest complaints from people who are infrequent viewers. It also will, hopefully, attract some of those individuals who usually are less inclined to watch American soccer, relegating themselves to the European versions. Here is just hoping the game is just&nbsp;interesting.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/major-league-mvps/">MVP Discussion: Soccer shares baseballs issues</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>In the wake of Major League Baseball awarding its <span class="caps">MVP</span> to <strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cabremi01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com">Miguel Cabrera</a></strong>, debates over what “valuable” means have once again flared up. Though soccer and baseball are two incredibly different sports, I think we can apply some of the same logic to both <span class="caps">MVP</span> discussions. Major League Soccer has about two weeks remaining before its MVP award is handed out, and we will no doubt encounter many of the same controversies in the soccer blogosphere that appear in baseball every season. The MVP controversy usually begins with what “valuable” means. I think there’s little doubt in most people’s minds that “valuable” and “skilled” are correlated. The main controversy is <em>how</em> correlated. To some, asking who was the <em>best</em> player in Major League Soccer in 2013 would be equivalent to asking who was the <em>most valuable</em> to his team. <strong>To others, there would be some key distinctions, the most common of which is that MVPs must come from teams that reach the post season.</strong> In retort to that thinking, some very astute commenters in a Fangraphs.com forum offered up these nuggets. Hendu for Kutch <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/trout-and-cabrera-here-we-go-again/">made the analogy</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We each want to buy something that costs $1. I’ve got a quarter, 8 nickels, and 10 pennies. My ‘team’ of coins is worth 75 cents and falls short of being able to buy the item. You have one dime and 18 nickels. Your ‘team’ is worth $1, and you successfully buy the item. Is your dime more valuable than my quarter simply because it led to a successful item&nbsp;purchase?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/t/troutmi01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com">Mike Trout</a></strong> = quarter and Miguel Cabrera = dime, for those of you not so into baseball, and the question is a good one. Few would argue that the dime is more valuable than the quarter just because it found itself in a position to help buy that scrumptious&nbsp;Twix.</p>
<p>In reply to someone arguing that the quarter had no value because it didn’t lead to the purchase of a desired item, <span class="caps">BIP</span> and ndavis910 then chimed&nbsp;in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Except not everything costs $1, and at any rate, you would always choose the quarter over the dime when accumulating money for a&nbsp;purchase.”</p>
<p>“Especially when you don’t know the cost of the items until you get to the store. In baseball, a team cannot be sure how many wins it will take to reach the playoffs until the last day of the season. In your example, the quarter is the most valuable piece regardless of whether or not the item cost $1 or&nbsp;$0.75.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When thinking about attributing value to players like Marco Di Vaio, Mike Magee, Camilo Sanvezzo, Robbie Keane and company, why should it matter where their teams finished? If one believes that Magee, for instance, is the best player in <span class="caps">MLS</span>, then does it matter if he took his team from 39 points to 49, versus from 40 points to 50? Either way, it’s still ten points of value in the standings. When Magee was traded to Chicago, neither Chicago nor Magee knew that the Fire was going to need 50 points to make the playoffs. The fact that they got just 49 points shouldn’t negate any of Magee’s&nbsp;value.</p>
<p>If you say that it matters because <span class="caps">MLS</span> clubs get real value from extra playoff games, then think about this. Playoff cutoff lines are quite arbitrary. If MLS allowed only the top two teams in from each conference—-not completely unreasonable for a league of just 19 teams—-then none of the players mentioned above would be considered under this playoffs requirement. Playoffs represent an arbitrary bar that the players competing for the award don’t get to set, and while reaching the playoffs does bring the team measurable revenue and value, basing an award on something outside an individual’s control would, in my opinion, strip the award of its intended meaning and&nbsp;purpose.</p>
<p>Now let’s anticipate the logical counterargument—-that players pick up their games in playoff races and play well when it matters&nbsp;most.</p>
<p>For a moment, let’s ignore the fact that little evidence has ever been found in professional sports that players can turn it on and turn it off as needed. This past season, Magee scored seven goals in Chicago’s final nine games, a stretch in which the team averaged 1.56 points per match. That represents a pace that would have gotten the Fire into the playoffs if maintained for the entire season. Di Vaio scored five goals in his last 10 games—-I even included that tenth-to-last game in which he scored two goals—-in a stretch where Montreal tallied just 0.7 points per match, limping into the playoffs on a tie-breaker with Chicago. Just because one team makes the playoffs doesn’t mean its best player was at his peak when it mattered. Goals are, admittedly, a narrow-minded way to measure a striker’s value, but I think the point is still&nbsp;valid.</p>
<p>For me, the Magee-Di Vaio example above may have been no more than an exercise in confirmation bias. I chose to see what I already believed. However, the logic behind the belief that team standings shouldn’t matter to players’ <span class="caps">MVP</span> merits is still good stuff, and transcends any biased example I can come up&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>If we’re ready to agree that that the <span class="caps">MVP</span> award should essentially be given to the best overall player, then we still have a tall task ahead of us. How do we measure skill on the soccer field? That is the 64,000-dollar question, and one <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/projects/field-player-value/">we hope to help tackle</a> here at <span class="caps">ASA</span> some day. But perhaps it’s not so crazy to think that a guy like Federico Higuain <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/11/05/a-closer-look-at-the-mls-mvp-race/">is deserving of the <span class="caps">MVP</span> award</a>. If you scoff at that notion, you likely do so because you’ve been trained to think about <span class="caps">MVP</span> awards in a certain&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>We’re all about re-thinking things around&nbsp;here.</p>
