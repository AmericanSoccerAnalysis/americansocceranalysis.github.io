          <section class="content"><p>This was suppose to be a quick 15-to-20-minute podcast that turned into an almost 52-minute single segment ramble about all things <span class="caps">US</span> in the past week.

            <h2><a href="/articles/colorados-playoff-chances/">Colorado's Playoff Chances.</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>A few short months ago, we recorded <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/06/01/mls-soccer-podcast/">a podcast</a> in which we discussed the teams likely to make the playoffs in the Western Conference. At the time, we did not think Colorado would get in, but now—-after a surprising win in Los Angeles—-the Rapids find themselves very much in the thick of the playoff race. As of May 31<span class="ord">st</span>, Colorado had earned 19 points from 13 games and sat in 5<span class="ord">th</span> place out west. Additionally, the Rapids’ 1.03 attempts ratio was 6<span class="ord">th</span> in the conference, while our shot locations data suggested an expected goal differential essentially tied for 4<span class="ord">th</span>. Perhaps we shouldn’t have discarded them so quickly. Now with more information, we’ve seen how shot ratios help to predict the future as well as anything in soccer. The predictions aren’t awesome, but better than if we were to use goal differential or standings. Colorado has found itself <em><strong>still</strong></em> in playoff contention, and I think it is worth revisiting the playoff chances for the Western Conference’s mile-high team. Now, 28 weeks into the season, Colorado has improved its shots ratios and expected goal differential to <strong><em>second in the conference</em></strong>, just behind the Galaxy on both accounts. But while Colorado could very well be one of the top teams in the West, its remaining schedule is pretty brutal. Of its last six matches, five of them come against Dallas, Portland, San Jose and Vancouver (twice). Those are the four teams fighting along with the Rapids for the final two playoff spots. The other game on their schedule just so happens to be Seattle, the current favorite to win the Supporters’ Shield. There is not a single cupcake on the schedule, and losses will be far more costly than if they were against Eastern Conference foes. While the best predictions using shots data still leaves much to be desired, that data would in fact pick Colorado as the second best team in the West. However, playing a tough schedule against opponents shooting for the same playoff spot, there is so much weight on just a few games. I’d pick Colorado to be one of those top five in the tables at the end, but it’s not a gimme pick. Let’s say, ooooh,&nbsp;55%.</p>

<p>We moved days! We’ll be getting the podcast to you Thursday night/Friday morning from here on out. You know, rather than getting it to you on Sunday after all the weekends games have been played. If nothing else, it should give you something great* to hear on your way to the match. This episode, we devote our second segment to talking about the <span class="caps">MLS</span> Front offices and geeks vs. nerds, and then we also touch on women in the front office as well as in the coaches’ boxes. Among other things we play a couple of silly games and then, of course, talk random news and notes for the past week. Hope you enjoy!

            <h2><a href="/articles/mike-magee-juan-agudelo-power-of-one-player/">A Short Exercise in the Power of a Player: Mike Magee and Juan Agudelo Observed</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I asked the question on Twitter, “how many teams have been better than Chicago since the arrival of Mike Magee?” Let’s take a look at the results of games played since the acquisition of Magee on May 24<span class="ord">th</span>. <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/ppg-sincemay24.png" alt="PPG-sinceMay24"> I think we knew that the Fire have been good since the arrival of Magee, but just how good is pretty surprising. Adding to the surprise are both the Whitecaps and Revolution with 1.6 points per game.  Looking to the bottom of the table we see how far <span class="caps">FC</span> Dallas has dropped since their hot start to the season. I know that we all like to think that the results in March and April are vital, and to a degree they are—-there is no way that FC Dallas is even considering a run at the playoffs if it wasn’t for how they performed in Mar/Apr—-however, the season is long; there are nearly 8 months and 34 games. <a href="http://prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com/2013/09/03/a-reduced-28-game-mls-season-may-be-around-the-corner/">For now anyway…</a> I’ve long been of the belief that one player in soccer doesn’t make that big of a difference on an entire season and it’s table location. Sure, maybe Clint Dempsey takes Seattle from being an injury prone playoff-ish team to a contender for the Supporters Shield. But Chicago was, and is now, much better. Along with Chicago, New England’s performance needs mention too. Currently, the minute men have 17 points through 8 matches with Juan Agudelo in the line-up. Something pointed out to me by the folks over at <a href="https://twitter.com/DeepInTheFort">Deep in the Fort</a>.  It’s also a conclusion that makes me question how much that’s true and how much a really good player can impact a season for a club. Obviously it needs a much closer observance than a single table of points over a time period. There are other factors to consider with both clubs. Regression, sample size, ect. But there is enough there to at least consider further research into the thought that some players can mean big things for the right&nbsp;club.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>During tonight’s podcast we will be talking a bit about the constructs of <span class="caps">MLS</span> offices. It’s easy to question the thinking behind transactions and player dealings. Each person has a specific idea behind the move and their own end game and plan that they wish to execute.  Personnel decision making is an important skill. We can find out more about some of the these skills if we actually know the individuals behind the desk of their respective clubs. This list is far from exhaustive. The effort is to give a single point of reference for front office types in each MLS club. The problem behind this little pilot study is that not all them are singularly responsible for the decision making as there are others: CEOs, CFOs, Presidents and a myriad of others that help influence these decisions. That said this is a good start to getting an idea as to who is pulling some of the strings when it comes to putting together the 30-man roster and dealing with the salary cap. The list is sorted according to the current (9/4) Supporter Shield&nbsp;standings. </p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/mls-park-factors/">Park Effects: How does this apply in MLS?</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This sparked my curiosity the other day. Joe Posnanski, who is an amazing baseball writer, wrote about the current <span class="caps">MVP</span> race as the MLB season dwindles down. One of his <a href="http://joeposnanski.blogspot.com/2013/08/explaining-cabrera-trout-and-war.html">large points is, of course, offensive production</a> and how you properly place that into context. He mentions something about park factors between the two hitters in the race, young stud Mike Trout and hall-of-fame surefire Miguel Cabrera. As usual, this discussion of value in baseball spawned chaos in the comments section and lead to a follow-up article. JoePo breaks down park factors crudely but effectively in stating the&nbsp;following: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the <span class="caps">BASICS</span> of Park Factors are the easiest thing imaginable. All you do is this: Step one: You take the average runs scored in a ballpark (both teams). Step two: You take the average runs scored in that team’s road games (both teams). Step three: You divide the first total by the second. And that’s all. Park Factors. There is so much contentiousness about Comerica Park but it’s all simple math. This year, the Tigers have scored 355 runs at Comerica and allowed 275 runs. That’s a total of 630 runs in 67 games — 9.4 runs per&nbsp;game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, this was brought to my attention by <a href="http://tangotiger.com/index.php/site/comments/how-to-calculate-park-factors-by-poz?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed">Tom Tango and his mention on his blog</a>. Tango also gives some brief qualifiers that are specific to baseball, as well as mentioning the uncertainty of the exact degree that it affects the race. It’s some great stuff for baseball. It made me start wondering about park conditions in <span class="caps">MLS</span>. It’s obvious that pitches play differently and that they come in different shapes and sizes. This can be done a multitude of ways as mention by Poz and <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/about/parkadjust.shtml">described by Basellball-Reference</a>. It’s already been covered one way by <a href="http://tempofreesoccer.blogspot.com/">Alex Olshansky of Tempo-Free Soccer</a> in an article for StatsBomb a month ago. However, Alex used Goal differential. Which is fine, if we’re strictly speaking about an individual park leading to more goals, not necessarily home field advantage. I wrote an article just a month ago about <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/08/01/mls-home-field-advantage-and-success-rates/">home field advantage</a> working off percentage of points won at home versus total points. Regardless, you can see most teams seem have an advantage playing at home. But I’m interested in how many of these home locations either increase limit or increase shots/goal opportunities. Is there a place in <span class="caps">MLS</span> that, due to the dimensions or the crowd or some other outside reason, it is better to be a striker versus a defender? That it limits or maybe creates more goal scoring opportunities? It’s an interesting question for certain and maybe not even one to limit to goals. Maybe we could open it up to turnovers, as that might give us some indication of the quality of the pitch. These are just some thoughts on a Friday&nbsp;afternoon.</p>
