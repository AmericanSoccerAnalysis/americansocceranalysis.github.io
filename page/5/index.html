          <section class="content"><p>I’m not usually interested in sports betting. I think most would find that surprising because we run an analytics site, and most analytics fit jointly, at least in Europe, with gambling. I avoid gambling for numerous reasons, but in general because I like the money I have and would hate to lose it.  However, there is a bit of value in looking at the betting lines and understanding which teams are favorites and why. It can give us a bit of early insight into who people consider “the best” teams. In case you missed it, Las Vegas odd makers metaphorically walked to the front of the class room and posted the first pre-season grades, identifying who they believe to the best teams in <span class="caps">MLS</span>. Basically they painted big red targets on the back of the LA Galaxy and Sporting Kansas City going forward. Here is a little snap shot of the complete lines, <a href="http://prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com/2014/01/27/early-odds-for-2014-mls-cup-champions-are-out/">courtesy of Steve Davis and NBCSports</a>. <img src="http://nbcprosoccertalk.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/mls-cup-odds.png" alt=""> Here are few things that pop out at me just looking at this list. First, the <span class="caps">LA</span> Galaxy are a club that we liked a lot going into the MLS Cup. We ranked them second in terms of the probability of winning the Supporters Shield and then third in the likelihood of winning the end of season tournament. Being cast aside by Real Salt Lake in the first round was not unimaginable, and yet it kind of took us all back for a moment. It’s not surprising to me that they probably hoist the imaginary pre-season trophy at this point. Second, Portland and Seattle are neck and neck in odds. If you thought the rivalry between these two I-5 teams culminated with the playoff match, you have another thing coming. This season is going to be rife with parity, and the difference between the 1<span class="ord">st</span> seed and the 5<span class="ord">th</span> could be substantially less than what it’s been in a number of years. This is only going to throw more wood on the fire for clubs like Seattle and Portland, creating an even more tension filled stadium. Oh, hey Vancouver, you’re there also… your just not “there” yet. Third, Toronto goes from being on the worst teams in the league to big signings and having the 8<span class="ord">th</span> best odds to come home with silverware at the end of the season. The tides look on the brink of turning in the Queen City and could yield a very fun summer for the Reds. Some thing well deserved for their fans with the incredible support shown through some disappointing years, and really since their arrival to MLS in 2008. Lastly, who could blame you if really you wanted to throw five dollars down on DC United. Eddie Johnson/Fabian Espindola, a rebuilt back line, and young potential US internationals in Perry Kitchen and Bill Hamid. 50-1 odds? Heck, I may just throw 20 dollars on them and become a season long United&nbsp;fan.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/more-rambling-thoughts-on-formations/">More rambling thoughts on formations</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p><em>A big thanks to <a href="http://www.sounderatheart.com/2014/1/25/5346144/training-camp-day-one-style-to-come-oba-gets-chippy-trialists-galore">Dave Clark (or to whomever he got them from) of Sounder[at]Heart</a>, from whom I’m about to rip the following quotes. </em> Today during an pre-season opening presser with the media, Seattle Sounders head coach Sigi Schmid addressed questions concerning his roster construction and the possibilities of what type of formations the team could deploy this season. This is a pressing matter among most Sounders supporters who are attempting to peer inside the tactics of this unusual off-season of maneuvers for the&nbsp;club. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have an idea, as in terms of what we want to do. We want to play two upfront. We think we’re better with two upfront and Dempsey, I think, is more effective when he has two guys in front of him… It’s like I always say, people get too hung up in ‘Is it a diamond midfield? Is it a 4-4-2? Is it a 4-2-3-1?’ It’s all about how players play on different parts of the field. Players like to play in certain areas of the field and they like to drift to certain areas. We just need to construct a system, if you want to call it that, and place guys on the field where they can compliment each other and be able to take advantage of where they like to play and what they do&nbsp;well.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, I love this because I think it truly reflects the current incarnation of soccer. Players are smarter now and more endowed with Soccer <span class="caps">IQ</span> than what they were years ago. Finding players that function best in certain areas of the field where your team needs it most should be the goal of any front office. I always loved <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/03/01/armchair-analyst-why-we-often-miss-point-when-we-talk-formations">this quote</a> from Dominic Kinnear, who told Matthew Doyle, the <span class="caps">MLS</span> Soccer Armchair Analyst, “You either have the ball or you don’t, I’m not a big fan of talking formations.” There is just so much awesomeness there in the sense that Dom takes a complicated intrinsic function of the coach, and instead of further vague direction, he simplifies it. Again, I’ve said it before that formations and placement matter. There was a reason that Seattle struggled last year when they used Adam Moffat in an awkward and unfamiliar location as they attempted to implement a diamond formation in an effort accentuate the talents of newly acquired Clint Dempsey. This ended up a bad decision for quite a few different reasons, outside of the fact that Adam Moffat just wasn’t very good in his appearances at that position. Another problem with the Sounders last season was their problem with certain players drifting across various places on the pitch, where I don’t think the coaching staff had planned for them to be. This caused problems early in the season despite the level of talent at their disposal. A specific example would be Mario Martinez and his tendency to wander. This might not have been factored or accounted for as they deployed him to wide positions. Maybe they had expectations of him residing as a true winger in the vein of Mauro Rosales. I’m not sure this is specifically an issue so much as, if it’s taken into account, you just get players to drift into the open spaces that are created with that movement. You can call this a free flowing system or a variety of many other things. I suppose it doesn’t really matter all that much. The important take away is that you have a method in place to score goals and prevent them from being scored against you. Whether you choose to exercise a formation to best do that or not, we’re all judged by results. It’ll be interesting to see how the Dynamo and Sounders continue to develop over the 2014&nbsp;season.</p>

          <section class="content"><p><em>Please welcome to our little team of analysists and helpers Chris Gluck, whose <span class="caps">PWP</span> is going to be added to the metrics table this year—-a solid instrument in telling us how teams have performed in turning possession into goals. Currently it’s one of the best _open-source _metrics out there to tell us such things. I hope you’ll enjoy his contributions as much I will - Harrison</em> <strong>First things first —- my thanks to Harrison Crow and Matthias Kullowatz for the opportunity to post my Possession with Purpose Introduction on American Soccer Analysis.</strong> If you’ve been following me this past year through <a href="http://blogs.columbian.com/portland-timbers/">Columbian Newspaper</a>&#8211;out of southern Washington—you’ll know that I’ve been researching statistics in Major League Soccer. My intent has been to develop a simplified (Strategic) set of team performance indicators that may help others better understand soccer and how the outcome of a game may be better understood based on the primary inputs to the game.  Data for my research comes from documenting and analyzing all 646 <span class="caps">MLS</span> Regular Season games in 2013; the source data originates with OPTA and is displayed on the MLS Chalkboard and the MLS Statistics Sheet found through <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/">www.mlssoccer.com</a>. <strong>With that here’s my introduction on Possession with Purpose… </strong> To first understand the context, I offer that this is one of the End States of my effort: <em>create a simplified approach and documented method for measuring team performance where the output is an Index that (while excluding points) comes close to matching results in the <span class="caps">MLS</span> League Table</em>. Beginning with that End State in mind here is the End State product: <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/pic1.jpg?w=890" alt="pic1"> <strong>Observations from the Diagram…</strong> Note that 9 of the top 10 teams in this Index made the <span class="caps">MLS</span> Playoffs last year with the Houston Dynamo finishing 12<span class="ord">th</span> in the Index.  For comparison, in benchmarking whoscored.com their Index only had 8 of their top 10 teams make the Playoffs, while www.squawka .com matched my 90% success rating, but the team they missed in the top 10 (New England) finished 16<span class="ord">th</span> in their Index. From a strategic standpoint, the End State objective has been met; <em>create a simplified approach and documented method for measuring team performance where the output is an Index that (while excluding points) comes close to matching results in the <span class="caps">MLS</span> League Table</em>.  <strong>Defining the <span class="caps">PWP</span> Attacking and Defending Processes…</strong> Here are the six steps in the <span class="caps">PWP</span> Strategic Attacking&nbsp;Process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gain possession of the&nbsp;ball,</li>
<li>Retain possession and move the&nbsp;ball,</li>
<li>Penetrate <span class="amp">&amp;</span> create goal scoring&nbsp;opportunities,</li>
<li>Take shots when provided goal scoring&nbsp;opportunities,</li>
<li>Put those shots taken on&nbsp;goal,</li>
<li><p>Score the goal.
Here are the six steps in the <span class="caps">PWP</span> Strategic Defending&nbsp;Process:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Minimize opponent gaining possession of the&nbsp;ball,</p>
</li>
<li>Minimize opponent retaining possession and moving the&nbsp;ball,</li>
<li>Minimize opponent penetrating and creating goal scoring&nbsp;opportunities,</li>
<li>Minimize opponent taking shots when provided goal scoring&nbsp;opportunities,</li>
<li>Minimize opponent putting those shots on&nbsp;goal,</li>
<li>Minimize opponent scoring the goal.
Every step is this process has an average success rate (percentage) based upon data gathered from all 646 <span class="caps">MLS</span> Regular Season games. <strong>Understanding the context of these steps versus other conditions and activities that influence the outcome of a game…</strong> In case you missed it I call these Processes and the Indices “Strategic” to separate their value/meaning relative to other things that can influence the outcome of a game. For me I have two other ways to classify information that can influence the outcomes in those steps. I have Operational conditions and Tactical metrics; provided below are some examples of&nbsp;each:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>Operational conditions</em>: Scheme of maneuver a team uses in setting up their system, such as flat-back four, flat-back three, double-pivot midfield, single-pivot midfield, bunkering with counterattacking, pressing high, direct attacking, possession-oriented attacking, weather conditions, location of the game (home/away), conference foe, non-conference foe,&nbsp;etc…</li>
<li><p><em>Tactical metrics</em>: Locations of shots taken, shots on goal, and goals scored; penalty kicks, free kicks, crosses, headers won/lost, tackles won/lost, interceptions, clearances, blocked crosses, blocked shots, etc. 
The diagram below shows the <span class="caps">PWP</span> Strategic Attacking Process with the average percentage of success rate in MLS for 2013. A more detailed explanation of each step is provided below the diagram. <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/pic2.jpg?w=890" alt="pic2"> <strong>Step 1: Gain possession of the ball:</strong> The intent behind this basic step should be clear; you can’t win the game if you don’t possess the ball to some extent. A second consideration about this step is that the more you possess the ball the less your opponent possesses the&nbsp;ball.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From a defensive standpoint there are any number of ways a team can work to gain possession of the ball; they include, but are not limited to, tackling, intercepting, clearing the ball, winning fifty-fifty duels on the ground or in the air, or simply gathering a loose ball based upon a deflection or bad&nbsp;pass.</p>
</li>
</ul>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>So, I kind of alluded to this on <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2014/01/02/asa-podcast-xxxiiii-the-one-where-we-talk-2013-defenses-eastern-conference/">Podcast <span class="caps">XXXIV</span></a> last week, but I wanted to start a conversation this week in regards to the very question that’s been ringing in my ears. With the alignment changes in regards to the <span class="caps">CONCACAF</span> Champions League bids, it puts a new emphasis on winning your conference in 2014 rather than the Supporters Shield—-which in times past has conflicted MLS between being conference-based system or as being a single-table entity. Now, with all these changes occurring, is there a reason to look at these two entities within Major League Soccer as being the same? It’s obvious that there was a split or a line drawn between three different echelons (good, meh and poor) within the Eastern Conference where in the West it was much tighter and distinct between who was good and who was… well, bad. When we enter 2014 and start looking at predictions, obviously you have to look at the picture as a whole and take into consideration and account for the inclusion of as many possible influences and pieces that could affect an outcome. That said, is it fair to compare the New York Red Bulls to the LA Galaxy anymore, or even compare Toronto FC to Chivas USA? These teams will have fewer and fewer overlapping influences, meaning that their results and outcomes are more conference-centric, right? It’s an interesting&nbsp;thought.</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Okay, so today we start our review of 2013 and look back at Eastern Conference defenses. We call Chicago, <span class="caps">DC</span> and Toronto terrible; I name New England the best defensive team—-alongside Sporting Kansas City—-and then add Columbus Crew as a dark horse for potential lowest goal against tally in 2014. We were privileged to have with us Bill Vegas, aka <a href="https://twitter.com/letskillrobots">@letskillrobots</a>,on the podcast tonight so please go out and give him a follow and check out his work over at ‘<a href="http://everybodysoccer.com/">Everybody Soccer</a>‘. We sadly didn’t get to talk about his children’s soccer book review, Five Iron Frenzy, their amazing trumpet player Leanor Ortega aka Jeff the Girl, or Andrew Schaub…maybe we need a not American Soccer Analysis podcast where we talk about the other things outside the soccer pitch that connect us as fans. If so, I’m pretty sure he’d be one of the best guests for me to talk to. Anyway, there were some moments in which Drew and I both messed up during today’s podcast, and here follow the obligatory corrections. A) I said that this is podcast 33… that’s wrong. 33 was last year, this is Season 2, Episode 1 or 34… I’m not sure which I’m going to call it yet. Taking notes and general opinions. B) Drew stated that Chad Marshall was traded for Steve Clark. That’s not true, but it was all really close together, and considering that Seattle really got nothing for Clarke—-kind of like Columbus gave nothing up for Marshall—-it kind of is the same thing. C) I said it was Ted Knuterson that ran StatBombs. It is Ted Knutson. I’m a goober. D) I made 14 other mistakes… if you can find them all and list each one in the comments, you can have a $1 gift card to Amazon.com. <span class="caps">REALLY</span>!

            <h2><a href="/articles/positions-and-the-diminishing-value-of-formations/">Positions and The Diminishing Value of Formations</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>It’s Christmas Eve, so what better time to highlight an article by <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/dec/18/question-holding-midfielders-changing-role">Jonathan Wilson of the <span class="caps">UK</span> Guardian</a> which talks a little about formations and the future of positions in&nbsp;soccer?! </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As positions become more specialised, as we divide the holder into destroyer, regista and carrier, and all points in between, so the importance of formations has diminished. Terms like 4-4-2 or 4-2-3-1 are useful as a rough guide, but only that: the higher the level, the more teams are agglomerations of bundles of attributes; the key is balance rather than fitting to some abstract designation, even if that shape can be useful in the defensive&nbsp;phase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is something that Drew, Matthias and I have mentioned on past podcasts and something that I believe is a true within the “modern era” of soccer. Players are increasingly versatile, and as such are able to handle more duties on the pitch, as well as the fact that it’s being more expected of them. The reality is that we see players put into areas of the pitch based on what they are able to do and what makes them unique to the roster. Wilson speaks of position rather than an interpretation of what I assume is a&nbsp;role. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Parreira’s 4-6 vision of the future has been overtaken by a 3-7, either as three centre-backs or two centre-backs with a destroyer just in front of them. That is another discussion, but what is true is that to speak of a holding role is merely to describe a player’s position on the pitch and not how he interprets&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wilson here is speaking of Brazilian national team coach Carlos Alberto Parreira and his prediction that soccer would migrate to more ambiguous roles. Also this article was speaking specifically to the roles of midfielders, but I think we can safely apply his words to the attack as a whole. There is a possibility we may be seeing something of this prophecy come about in Major League Soccer in 2014. Teams such as Portland, Chicago, Columbus, New England, and even Seattle with some of it’s recent moves, have the pieces to move towards a 4-6 where they have a lesser-defined striker, or “false nine,” at the top of their formation. These teams’ capable scorers like <strong>Darlington Nagbe</strong>, <strong>Mike Magee</strong>, <strong>Federico Hinguian</strong>, <strong>Diego Fagundez</strong> and <strong>Clint Dempsey</strong> aren’t relegated to striker positions by convention, where they probably wouldn’t play best anyway. This isn’t to say that strikers or players of those specific roles and old time “mentality” is absolutely wrong or trash now. No, I think this is something that you incorporate. As Wilson said in his post, “it’s about balance,” and it’s about putting together a group of players that are able to A) create good shots on the opponent’s goal and B) defend and attempt to prevent shots against its own goal. This goes further into building a roster and down through a rabbit hole of discussion which I’m sure that we could have any time, and which would eventually eclipse my knowledge base. That said, I think this is real. I don’t think this is a fad but something that will be realized as a changing of the guard and a new way of thinking. I’ll excuse myself as I mutter something about idealism, while trying not to have the door hit me in the hindquarters as I woke&nbsp;out.</p>
