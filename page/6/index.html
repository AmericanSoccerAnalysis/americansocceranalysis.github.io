            <h2><a href="/articles/how-to-build-a-roster-chad-marshall-vs-bobby-boswell/">How to Build a Roster: Chad Marshall vs. Bobby Boswell</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>A topic that I’ve been exploring this off-season for myself is how to go about building a successful roster in <span class="caps">MLS</span> given all the various mechanism that are involved and a salary cap to work around. It’s not just how to build a successful roster, but how you would go about building one with sustainable success—-a task that many clubs find an incredibly difficult given the methodology of the league. The question I ask aloud is whether or not it’s a problem of being stubborn and trying to go about acquiring talent the way most in the world do, or using the system in place. This may or may not be a series that takes place over the course of the off-season. But last week there were a couple of transactions that occurred that struck my fancy in terms of how each front office went about it. Obviously there are factors that you have to consider, such as table placement, which in turn dictates allocation money and a various assortment of other little details. I think, overall, finding and acquiring defensive talent is a really tough task and I’m not entirely certain that you can go about trying to build for multiple years all in one off-season. Committing too much money to a single player can complicate roster moves for mid-season acquisitions, but can be easily cleared up in a single off-season with the help of the re-entry draft, various trades and the SuperDraft. The re-entry draft is a basic way to spread some of the talent across the league when clubs aren’t able to incorporate the players price tag under their cap. The draft—-if you aren’t familiar—-functions in two different stages, with teams selecting players working in reverse order of the seasons table. Stage 1: players selected have to either have their options exercised, or teams are required to offer. Stage 2: a team can offer the player basically a “genuine offer” meaning that there is potential that you can get the player a discount rate. Should a player not sign with team, the club holds the player’s league rights. Over the last week we saw what a team with allocation money can do in the re-entry draft. D.C. United acquired a hand full of players to upgrade their roster situation. One specific player of note is Bobby Boswell, a former MLS Defender of the Year, selected in the second round of the first stage. This means that D.C. United will offer a contract to Boswell that equates to 105% of his salary from the previous season and likely will be in the range of $235,000. Likewise the Seattle Sounders were also looking to upgrade their defensive options. They worked out a trade with the Columbus Crew to acquire another former MLS Defender of the Year, this time in the form of Chad Marshall. The Sounders surrendered allocation money and a 1<span class="ord">st</span> round draft pick to the 2015 SuperDraft. We can’t be certain how much allocation money was exchanged between the two teams but my understanding is that it’s somewhere around $75,000. Both players despite being in their late 20’s are solid individuals that will help their new clubs in a specific manner. Looking at the numbers, Seattle was one of the worst defensive teams that made the playoffs with a 0.95 shot attempt ratio that indicates they allow more shots against their goal than they produce for themselves.  D.C. United was just simply abysmal on all fronts, and that fact needs no objective proof. They just sucked. You know it, I know it, and everyone knows it. <strong>Chad Marshall</strong> and <strong>Bobby Boswell</strong> both finished in the top-10 of defensive actions ranking 3<span class="ord">rd</span> and 7<span class="ord">th</span> overall. This doesn’t necessarily imply any value, as I’ve yet to find any studies that can correlate blocked shots with goals saved, though I think it would be an interesting study. That said, any time you can spend money to potentially reduce the amount of shots your team faces is a good thing. Either way Marshall and Boswell are very similar players in age, style and tactics. But they were acquired by different methods as the Sounders basically spent $125,000 in controlled assets to obtain his rights. <span class="caps">DC</span> spent and extra 5% on top of Boswells previous salary to pluck him from the Houston Dynamo and the re-entry draft. Boswell will cost United roughly $235,000 in total numbers to put him on their squad. Assuming Marshall doesn’t negotiate his contract any further down, he’ll cost the Sounders $485,000 in both salary AND the assets they spent to acquire him. I think it’s funny how many people criticized the United’s front office in their move to select Boswell in the first stage, but the truth is they got a better value for the same piece as the Sounders giving up only half the assets. It’s easy to make fun of those that are already calling D.C. United “<a href="http://www.rantsports.com/soccer/2013/12/20/dc-united-early-favorite-to-win-2014-mls-cup/">an early favorite</a>“ for the <span class="caps">MLS</span> Cup. It’s impossible to know if any of these changes really help either Seattle or DC.  Admittedly it’s hard to not see the Red and Black improve from where they were last year, and adding the handful of upgrades across their roster and full season of a healthy Chris Pontius should help—-at the very least making their starting XI that much more&nbsp;handsome.</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>After Jimmy Nielsen retired on a high note, Sporting Kansas City wasted little time trading for Columbus’ starting No. 1, Andy Gruenebaum. <span class="caps">SKC</span> <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/20131216/crew-gruenebaum-clark-sounders-trade.ap/">gave up a second-round draft pick</a> to acquire Gruenebaum. Though a second-round pick in <span class="caps">MLS</span> is probably not as valuable as it is in, say, the NFL, Sporting has now essentially spent a draft pick on a <strong>backup</strong> goalkeeper because Vermes<a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/12/21/sporting-kc-manager-names-eric-kronberg-clubs-no-1-goalkeeper-after-signing-"> </a><a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/12/21/sporting-kc-manager-names-eric-kronberg-clubs-no-1-goalkeeper-after-signing-">named</a> Eric Kronberg the starter for&nbsp;2014. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The last two years, [Kronberg’s] been more than ready to try to assume the position,” Vermes said. “The difference is that Jimmy’s been on top of his&nbsp;game.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I haven’t seen Kronberg play at all because, well, <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/players/eric-kronberg">who has</a>? He’s only played 382 minutes over eight seasons—-about the equivalent of four full starts. But Vermes’ decision still perplexes me. For instance, Kronberg has played behind Nielsen for some time, and based on 2013 data, Nielsen was not a very good goalkeeper. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AttujdNBdATWdGh0a1V0QWp6ZHlLcDlJYmlyd1oxQkE&amp;output=html">This</a> from our own Will Reno and <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/shot-locations/goalkeeper-ratings/">this</a> from our shot locations data both suggest that Nielsen was basically “replacement level” this past season. Kronberg is not likely to be much better, if at all, since he was playing behind Nielsen. Then there’s Gruenebaum. I talked about him on <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/12/20/asa-podcast-xxxiii-the-one-where-we-talk-re-entry-draft/">the podcast</a> last week, but here’s the short of it. That same data up there suggests Gruenebaum was one of the better goalkeepers in <span class="caps">MLS</span> last season. Both Will and I independently arrived at our statistical ratings, and Will ranked Gruenebaum as the second-best keeper on a per-game basis, while I ranked him as the third-best in the league (among regular starters, by “Goal Ratio”). Nielsen was something like 16<span class="ord">th</span>. Kronberg watched Nielsen from the bench. Obviously, I haven’t been watching Kronberg train as I am not Peter Vermes. But two independent sets of keeper ratings make Gruenebaum sound like a top shelf No. 1, making this a puzzling decision from my, admittedly limited,&nbsp;perspective.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/does-last-season-matter-follow-up/">Does last season matter? - Follow Up</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I wrote <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/11/23/does-last-season-matter/">a few weeks ago</a> about the weak predictive information contained in a team’s previous season of data. When trying to predict a team’s goal differential in the <strong>second</strong> 17 games of a season, it was the <strong>first</strong> 17 games of that same season that did the job. The previous season’s data was largely unhelpful. @sea_soc tweeted me the following: <a href="https://twitter.com/sea_soc/status/406507942179905537">https://twitter.com/sea_soc/status/406507942179905537</a> Ask, and you shall receive. Here’s the weird shit I found when trying to project a seasons <strong>second-half</strong> goal&nbsp;differential: </p>
<p><strong>Stat</strong>
<strong>Coef.</strong>
<strong>P-Value</strong></p>
<p>Intercept
-33.6&nbsp;0.86%</p>
<p>AttemptDiff (first 17)
0.1&nbsp;0.00%</p>
<p>Finish Diff (first 17)
90.6&nbsp;0.12%</p>
<p><em><strong>Attempt Diff (first 17 last season)</strong></em>
<em><strong>0.1</strong></em>
<em><strong>2.88%</strong></em></p>
<p>Attempt Diff (second 17 last season
0.0&nbsp;20.00%</p>
<p><strong><em>Finish Diff (first 17 last season)</em></strong>
<strong><em>115.0</em></strong>
<strong><em>7.08%</em></strong></p>
<p>Finish Diff (second 17 last season)
-23.5&nbsp;28.81%</p>
<p>Home Games Left
4.0&nbsp;0.81%</p>
<p>Translation: Strangely, it’s the <strong>first part</strong> of the previous season that is the better predictor of future performance. Not the second part of last season, which actually happened more recently. In fact, information from the second part of each team’s previous season produced negative coefficients (negative relationships).&nbsp;Weird.</p>
<p>Now let’s change the response variable slightly to be a team’s goal differential from its <strong>first 17 games</strong>. Which does better at predicting, last season’s first half or last season’s second&nbsp;half?</p>
<p>Neither. In fact, there was nothing that came close to predicting the first halves of 2012 and&nbsp;2013.</p>
<p><strong>Stat</strong>
<strong>Coef.</strong>
<strong>P-value</strong></p>
<p>Intercept
18.9&nbsp;20.3%</p>
<p>Finish Diff (first 17 last season)
-5.5&nbsp;94.5%</p>
<p>Finish Diff (second 17 last season)
5.9&nbsp;60.9%</p>
<p>Attempt Diff (first 17 last season)
0.01&nbsp;26.6%</p>
<p>Attempt Diff (second 17 last season)
0.04&nbsp;32.5%</p>
<p>Home Games (first 17 this season)
-2.2
20.3%
With such small sample sizes, it could be there is just something really weird about the first halves, especially 2013. I say “especially 2013” because 2011 and 2012’s first halves seemed to do a fair job of projecting the next season’s second halves, so it’s 2013 that seems screwy. Portland and Seattle performed opposite of what would have been expected for each, for example, while <span class="caps">D.C.</span> United and Montreal did the same confusing switcheroo in the Eastern Conference to kick off the 2013 campaign. So it could have just been weird randomness. In the end, I’m quite certain of one thing, and that’s that I’m still&nbsp;confused.</p>

I really wanted to get something together since it’d been a couple weeks since we last recorded, and I felt there were some good topics for us to touch on. Today, we talk Portland, <span class="caps">DC</span> United, Seattle, while touching a bit on the Columbus and Sporting KC keeper trades.

          <section class="content"><p>Three things in this&nbsp;post:</p>
<p>1. <span class="caps">MLS</span> final 2. Goalkeeper of the Year Award 3. MLS Goalkeeper Final&nbsp;Destination</p>
<p><strong>1. <span class="caps">MLS</span> final </strong> [youtube=<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SJq24zFwoQ&amp;w=560&amp;h=315">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SJq24zFwoQ&amp;w=560&amp;h=315</a>] We were all made aware of the conditions before the game. The ice on the field, the cold temperatures, the effects on the ball… but then again, it’s the final in your sport so maybe it’s not the best time to come up with&nbsp;excuses.</p>
<p>The final featured <a href="/articles/mls-cup-thoughts-and-general-goal-keeper-roundup/www.pamplinmedia.com/pt/12-sports/203265-mls-awards-go-to-ricketts-valeri-">two of the three finalists</a> for Goalkeeper of the Year so we should expect an exciting display between both set of posts. This was not the case. Let’s walk through the&nbsp;video </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>0:58</strong> - Nick Rimando makes a half-falling/half-diving save in the twenty-fifth minute. It’s enough in his mitts that he can hold it, but he pushes it wide and almost bonks his&nbsp;head.</li>
<li><strong>1:28</strong> - Nielsen gets a little too far under a punch and sends it straight up in the air, almost setting up a gift of a&nbsp;goal.</li>
<li><strong>2:20</strong> - If you notice, this is the third highlight and we’re almost through the first half. That might tell you something. Rimando stays alert, and the bouncing ball isn’t in complete control of Dwyer. It’s a needed save but not that tough. Rimando has time to get there and Dwyer has a limited shooting angle on&nbsp;goal.</li>
<li><strong>2:40</strong> - Start of the second half sees <span class="caps">CJ</span> Sapong with the ball in front of goal yet again. Rimando gets caught going the wrong way when Sapong cuts off the cross. He tries to scramble to the post but luckily (for Rimando) the shot skies&nbsp;over.</li>
<li><p><strong>3:25</strong> - <span class="caps">RSL</span> gets the first goal of the game from a nice no-look-pass from Beckerman to Sabario who chests then volleys it home. But check out Nielsen’s starting position on the shot. <img src="http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-12-30-50-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 12.30.50 PM"> So far from the line! He could have chipped him if he tried (foreshadowing, wooOOoo!). Sabario takes the trap and Nielsen (who starts calling for a handball) is so far from the line he can’t get into position well enough (notice the green triangles below). If he’s closer to the line he can get into position better and he’ll have more time to react, likely making the save.

</li>
<li><p><strong>4:50</strong> - Beckerman takes a shot from distance. On the replay (5:12), check out Nielsen’s left foot: cemented into the ground. His right foot does all the moving. This is not good. Just turning your body to make a save really limits the distance you can cover. A quicker shuffle to Nielsen’s left can get a hand on that&nbsp;shot.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>5:25</strong> - Possibly the biggest “<span class="caps">LOL</span>” of the match. Nielsen is so far off his line that the most casual chip almost beats him. The ball doesn’t even clear the crossbar, if that tells you how non-chalant the chip was. <img src="http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-12-59-41-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 12.59.41 PM"> Nielsen turns around, surprised the ball is still in play, chases it out and eats snow hard.&nbsp;Woof.</li>
<li><strong>6:40</strong> - <span class="caps">SKC</span> equalizes with a questionably fair header…Rimando bounces over but can’t make the extension. [caption id=”attachment<em>912” align=”aligncenter” width=”490”]<img src="http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-1-03-38-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 1.03.38 PM"> _If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.</em>[/caption]</li>
<li><strong>7:20</strong> - Ninety-third minute and Rimando makes the “Allstate Good Hands Save of the Match”. A simple tip over from a blast eight yards&nbsp;out.</li>
<li><strong>7:50</strong> - Sapong with another chance while being&nbsp;mauled.</li>
<li><strong>8:25</strong> - I’ll just leave this picture to sum up the events here:<img src="http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-2-44-10-am.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 2.44.10 AM"></li>
<li>Apparently nothing happened for the next fifteen minutes and the penalties ensue. Here are the tendancies for Nielsen and Rimando:<img src="http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-1-19-58-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 1.19.58 PM"> The “n’s” and “y’s” are if the keepers guessed the correct way or not. A “y” means yes he did, obviously, and the asterisks mean that while he guessed correctly the ball missed the goal frame. The green represents all the times the shooter did not score (after five rounds it was 3-3, three reds each). Both goalkeepers guessed the right way four of the ten times. The last two columns are where the keepers were guessing. Rimando was 5-2-3 (left-middle-right) and Nielsen was 6-0-4. So if you needed any more proof that shootouts are more determined by the shooters than goalkeeper then… well I don’t know. This games looks pretty clear to me. Nielsen is painted as the shootout hero but almost has the exact same stats as Rimando, not to mention all his follies from the run of play. Also he’s about five feet off his line on the eighth-round shot. (I know the ball is well-past kicked at this point, but he was in the process of planting his foot so it was blurry. Also balls kicked travel faster than feet move.)<img src="http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-2-34-30-am.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 2.34.30 AM">
At least it was a fun game. We can all agree on&nbsp;that. </li>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Of those three teams, it’s the United States’s draw that incites the least of my&nbsp;frustration.</p>
<p>Search for “world cup draw” <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=world+cup+draw&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS382US382&amp;oq=world+cup+draw&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60l3.2402j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8">on Google</a>, and you’ll find mostly opinions that the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Mens National Team found itself in <strong>the</strong> group of death, as if there can only be one. But as many pointed out before the draw, the <span class="caps">USMNT</span> was not likely to get into an easier group. Coming from Pot 3, the USMNT was at a disadvantage already due to being in the weakest pot. Using ratings from Nate Silver’s <a href="http://espn.go.com/soccer/worldcup/news/_/id/4447078/GuideToSPI">Soccer Power Index</a> (<span class="caps">SPI</span>), here are the average ratings by each of the four&nbsp;pots:</p>
<p><strong>Pot</strong>
<strong>Rating</strong>
<strong>Standard&nbsp;Dev.</strong></p>
<p>1
85.9&nbsp;5.0</p>
<p>4
79.7&nbsp;3.3</p>
<p>2
76.2&nbsp;8.0</p>
<p><em><strong>3</strong></em>
<em><strong>73.7</strong></em>
<em><strong>3.5</strong></em></p>
<p>Since teams from the same pot could not meet in the group stage, the <span class="caps">USMNT</span> couldn’t draw any teams from its own pot. Thus it automatically got zero chance at playing some of the weaker teams in the opening round, leaving us praying for one of Switzerland or Belgium from the ranked Pot 1 to ease our path to glory (no such luck).  Additionally, all Pot 3 teams got a slightly higher chance of meeting two European teams in the group stages due to <a href="http://espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/1636989/fifa-confirms-pots-world-cup-draw?cc=5901">that additional <span class="caps">UEFA</span> team moving</a> from Pot 4 to Pot 2. Pot 3 teams eluding a European team from Pot 1 may still have gotten Italy or England (I can’t tell which one) from Pot 2. Costa Rica drew the short straw on that&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>If you look at Nate Silver’s  ratings, you’ll notice that most Pot 3 teams got pretty raw deals. Below are the chances that each team advances to the knockout round, as well as the average ratings for the other teams in their respective groups.
