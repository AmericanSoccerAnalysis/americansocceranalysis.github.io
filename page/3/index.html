            <h2><a href="/articles/season-preview-fc-dallas/">Season Preview: FC Dallas</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Over the past three seasons, fans of the Hoops have seen their team crash down from the high of a 2010 <span class="caps">MLS</span> Cup Finals appearance . In 2012, those same fans endured a 13-game winless streak, to be followed by another 11-game winless streak in 2013, resulting in Dallas missing the playoffs each of the past two seasons. What made matters worse was their red hot start to 2013, where they raced out to a 7-2-3 record and 24 points by the end of May, good for first place in the West. After missing out on the post season following such a hot start, Schellas Hyndman was shown the door (officially resigned), and former FC Dallas player and long time assistant Oscar Pareja was hired to right the ship. There is much optimism surrounding Dallas as they look to put the past behind them and get themselves back into the playoffs in&nbsp;2014.</p>

<p><img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/roster-dallas.png" alt="roster-dallas">Lots of optimism surround the Hoops after the theft appointment of <strong>Oscar</strong> “Papi” <strong>Pareja</strong> as head coach, and for good reason. The former Colorado Rapids head coach was highly regarded by the front office, was a contender for <span class="caps">MLS</span> <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/dalinfo1.png?w=182" alt="DALINFO">Coach of the Year after Colorado overachieved last season with their young roster, thanks in some part to Pareja’s&nbsp;guidance.</p>
<p>While the optimism is high, there are also some concerns with the team, as they jettisoned off a few key pieces from last year (Captain <strong>David Ferreira</strong>, striker <strong>Kenny Cooper</strong>, and winger <strong>Jackson</strong>), and now <span class="caps">FC</span> Dallas must work through that awkward transition where new faces and a new coach try to get on the same page. Will the front office and Dallas fans be patient enough to wait for Pareja to work his magic, given they’ve missed the playoffs two season in a row now? His first season in Colorado was forgettable (11-19-4, no playoffs), but there were clear signs of improvement in his second year (14-11-9, knock out&nbsp;rounds).</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>The newest franchise in Major League Soccer, the Montreal Impact, has carved out its niche pretty distinctly since inception in 2012. With strong ties to Serie A through multiple Italian players, Montreal has seen decent success for such a new franchise. They just missed the playoffs in their expansion year, and sneaked in as the five seed last year. But with the success has come another reputation: they already seem rather fond of changing coaches. Entering their third season of play, Montreal’s owner Joey Saputo is already onto his third manager, with Frank Klopas taking the wheel in 2014. <strong>2013 Finish: 49 Points, 5<span class="ord">th</span> in Eastern Conference, Qualified for <span class="caps">MLS</span> Cup playoff, lost in conference play-in round.</strong> <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/montrealxi.png" alt="MontrealXI"></p>

<strong>Roster Churn:</strong> 82.98% returning minutes (4<span class="ord">th</span> highest in <span class="caps">MLS</span>) <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/roster-montreal.png" alt="roster-Montreal">2013 started out about as perfect as any Impact fan could have hoped. But the team then coughed, sputtered, and wheezed its way into the wildcard round of the postseason, where th<img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/mtlinfo3.png?w=182" alt="MTLINFO">e coughing and wheezing turned to seizing, and Montreal’s campaign met an early demise. Marco Schallibaum’s tenure started with a bang, as Montreal won each of its first four games by one tally each, all of them by a scoreline of 1-0 or 2-1. Those close, low-scoring victories figured to set the tone for the season—-Montreal was a stout defensive team who would get bodies behind the ball and look to finish swift counter-attacks through <strong>Marco Di Vaio</strong>. This formula helped them to win the Canadian Championship for a second year running, qualifying them for next season’s <span class="caps">CONCACAF</span> Champions League. Unfortunately, their tactical secret wasn’t particularly well-kept throughout the league, as opposing teams figured out how to counter the Impact’s strategy after about the first third of the season. The regular season’s final 20 games saw only five Montreal victories, as they earned just a point per game during that span while simultaneously crashing out of last year’s CCL. Still, their hot start was enough to squeeze into the Eastern Conference knockout round, as they slipped into the five seed thanks to a superior goal difference to Chicago. But the luck would run out for Schallibaum and the French-Canadian club in a hurry, as they were beaten and outclassed by the Houston Dynamo in the do-or-die playoff, 3-0. The game was as damaging to Montreal’s reputation, too, as <strong>Nelson Rivas</strong>, <strong>Andres Romero</strong> and Di Vaio were all ejected for various infractions. The last moments of the match devolved into more of a cat-fight than a soccer match, with the men in blue performing the side of jealous aggressors. In the end, not only was the season over but so too was Schallibaum’s tenure in Montreal; he was fired a few weeks later. I’ll be frank: it’s hard to imagine that this year’s Montreal Impact is much improved over last year’s iteration. And with seemingly every other team in the Eastern Conference signing big name Designated Players, it would follow that Montreal’s stagnation would see them drop a few rungs in the standings this season. Don’t take my word for it – just ask central defender <strong>Matteo Ferrari</strong>. Here’s a clue for the future expansion sides in <span class="caps">MLS</span>: it’s never a good sign when your club has to release a statement clarifying that one of your top players is in fact on the same page as your technical&nbsp;director.</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Most people would associate Chivas <span class="caps">USA</span> with the pinnacle of terribleness within MLS. They’ve accrued all of 56 points combined the last two seasons which barely eclipses the LA Galaxy totals, their evil timeshare neighbor, over the course of just one year. The club from the beginning has sported a feel that was awkward—-almost insulting—-and it has been a bit of an outcast from the rest of the league. Despite what we all know about them now, it’s easy to forget that as few as five years ago they were the more dominant LA brand, earning top-three finishes in 2006, 2007 and in 2008. They were lead by the likes of US internationals <strong>Brad Guzan</strong>, <strong>Sacha Kljestan</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Bornstein</strong>. They boasted the scoring prowess of <strong>Ante Razov</strong>, one of the premier scoring talents in <span class="caps">MLS</span> history, who is still the club’s all-time goal scorer. Despite the recent woes, it’s not outside the realm of possibility that they could return to a run of strong form. But it will likely need to be built upon the youth and Academy products they’ve been working to develop, as Chivas USA has been cited as one of the more talent rich organizations at the youth level. Make no mistake about it; things are just starting to get interesting in the City of Angels. <strong>2013 Finish: 26 points, 9<span class="ord">th</span> in the Western Conference, Missed Playoffs</strong> <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/chivasxi.png" alt="ChivasXI"></p>

But then a steady fall ensued that has seen the club completely miss out on the playoffs each of the last two seasons. This led to the dismissal of long-time fixture Warzycha, who had been a part of the club since it’s inception in 1996.  Add this to the Hunt family finally selling off its ownership of the club, and you have a full docket of changes that have occurred around Crew Stadium. Unfortunately for Columbus, none these are indicators that the club will improve, at least in the short term. <strong>2013 Finish: 41 Points, 8<span class="ord">th</span> in the Eastern Conference, Missed <span class="caps">MLS</span> Playoffs</strong> <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/columbuslineup.png" alt="ColumbusLineup"></p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Now that we’ve been pestering you all by tweeting, sharing, spamming, and pretty much all-out begging for you to participate in our pre-season <span class="caps">MLS</span> standings survey, we feel it’s only fair that we share it with you! Thanks to you guys, we got hundreds of votes, so I first want to say thank you for all that. Thanks. Part of the exercise was to see what you all thought of how the table will shape up more than 35 weeks from now. Yes, there were transactions that happened in the middle of the polling, and it probably changed the way we thought about how to rank teams in some cases. But crazy as it might seem, the poll produced results showing definitive tiers between teams. There are a lot of various theories about how one might go about making “power rankings,” and while it’s a pretty arbitrary endeavor—-who is to say that any result is right or wrong?—-I think common sense could easily rebuff the three people who voted <strong>Chivas <span class="caps">USA</span></strong> with a #1 overall finish in the West. That’s just crazy. The other side of the exercise was to, come November, make a point. Perhaps an obvious point that can go without saying, but a point. The idea that, during the pre-season, we could accurately project standings is contemptible (but it will be interesting to see how you all do collectively). Basically, I get agitated when I see a narrative that states “Who would have seen this coming?” or when someone makes a grand claim that “No one thought ‘Team X’ was going to be this bad!” Who decided he could speak for everyone? Now, we can speak for, at least, a few hundred people at the end of the 2014 season when we say, “Who could have seen Chivas doing so well? Oh, it was you three!” (Just kidding. That won’t happen.) The individuals who participated in this project are mostly those of a select, niche community—-well, and my mom—-and you will (hopefully) help me with my agitation. Speaking now as to specific methods of organizing and ranking the standings from the poll results: if you scrape a bunch of opinions from fans of various teams and get perspectives of supporters from 400+ backgrounds and locales, I believe it’s possible that you can sift through some of the bias that often occurs when just a few people share opinions. It’s a crowdsourced cocktail made without disposition, and still delicious. While it’s far from perfect, I find it’s a pretty good barometer. While we plan on releasing the final results of the said crowd sourcing project in two weeks (March 7<span class="ord">th</span>), we’re also in the process of putting together our pre-season team previews. We’ve got a great pool of writers that have taken a lot of time to put this together, and have also been helping us gather data that should yield even more new statistics and analyses this year. This isn’t just about us generating content. It’s an opportunity for these guys to get a shout out for all that they’ve done. Most will be joining us on a podcast next week where you’ll get to hear from them and hopefully get an introduction of sorts. We will publish the team previews beginning this afternoon in the order in which the clubs scored on the survey, from worst to first, alternating between Eastern and Western Conference. Posts will go up each day until the beginning of the season. Happy 2014,&nbsp;everyone!</p>

<p>Hey guys, you know how you join a fantasy league every year at the start of a season, and then you forget about it until the dying weeks of the season, once things get exciting? Well we want to you to do that in our league this year! Don’t make me beg, because I’ll do it! Oh, but you think you’re not cool enough to hang with all of us? Newsflash: our levels of fantasy intelligence and attention to our rosters could both be described as mediocre. Just like you. And wait! There’s more! The winner of this said league will win … something. I promise it’ll be something. I’ve been playing with a few ideas and regardless of what you may have heard of me, I’ve still got a few original ideas. For instance: How about a gift card to Texas Roadhouse? That place is like… awesome. You can eat peanuts and just throw it on the floor. <span class="caps">IT</span>’S ANARCHY! True story: I once ate there on thanksgiving and it was okay. I’m a story teller, what can I say? Oh, what’s that? Texas Roadhouse gift card isn’t the coolest thing in the world? You have a peanut allergy? You live in Texas and that’s just a normal day for you? No problemo. We’ll trash that idea. I never liked it any how. What about a trip to Disneyland?!? Oh, wait. <em>Opens wallet</em> Nope, can’t do that. We’re still poor. Okay. Whatever the prize, and I’ll make sure it’s good, you could win it, and you’ll be like, “this was so worth the five minutes of setting my line-up while  some guy cries at his computer and screams in all caps ‘I <span class="caps">SPENT</span> MORE THAN 10 HOURS A WEEK RESEARCHING TO WIN THIS DUMB LEAGUE.’” And you’ll laugh—-hell we’ll all laugh—-because remember: we don’t remember to check our line-ups either. All you have to do is log in to mlssoccer.com, go to the fantasy section,  join private league, and enter code <strong>9593-1668</strong> to enter into this esteemed gathering of nerds that will probably talk a much bigger game than they are actually capable of backing&nbsp;up.</p>
