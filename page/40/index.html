            <h2><a href="/articles/possession-confusion/">Possession Confusion</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Consider every conversation ever had about soccer tactics. I would bet 99.9% of them touched on one specific subject: <strong><em>possession</em></strong>. Whether it’s the men’s league team you play for, or the club team you cheer for, isn’t more possession always a good thing? I can’t answer that question confidently, but I will explore it. The first obstacle to analyzing and discussing possession in <span class="caps">MLS</span> is the data itself. We get our data from Opta, and this is what Opta defines as&nbsp;possession: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the game, the passes for each team are totaled up, and then each team’s total is divided by the game total to produce a percentage figure which shows the percentage of the game that each team has accrued in possession of the&nbsp;ball.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Possession” in Opta’s data is thus a measure of the proportion of completed passes in a match for each team, <strong><em>not </em></strong>a proportion of time. A lot of short, quick passes will accrue possession for a team that may only have the ball for a matter of seconds. This isn’t necessarily bad or good. It is what it is, and we’ll work with it.  Not all passes are created equally—-or better put, not all teams’ passes average out to be equally effective—-but for a moment let’s suppose that they are. It’s hard to gather data on the value of each pass, and hard to then weight teams’ passes accordingly. So let’s just stick with the assumption that all teams’ passes are equally effective. Perhaps someday we can sit around drinking beer and punching holes in that assumption. Today is not that day. Under that assumption of equal passes, a team that completes a higher proportion of passes than its opponent will likely have strung together effective buildup more often than its opponent. Having created more effective build up, that team will likely have earned more scoring opportunities than its opponent. Having earned more scoring opportunities than its opponent, that team will be more likely to score goals and nab points. So this sort of possession should really imply sunshine and rainbows for the participating team. Seems like fair logic to me, but of course, I’m the one writing. Looking at the <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/">tables</a>—tables that were created with Opta’s version of possession, remember—we don’t see a strong correlation between possession and results. Four of the top five teams (by points per match) have 50% possession or less, but overall there is still a weakly <em><strong>positive</strong></em> correlation. We start to get significant results when we assess the correlations between teams’ possession and Attempt Ratios (0.60<em>), and again with Shots on Goal Ratios (0.55</em>). Those positive correlations imply that <strong><em>more possession</em></strong> coincides with <strong><em>more scoring</em></strong> <strong><em>chances.</em></strong> Of course, there is not nececelery a causal link. Let’s take a look at this from another perspective. If we look at the relationships <strong><em>game-by-game</em></strong>—rather than <strong><em>team-by-team</em></strong>—the correlation between possession and scoring chances is still positive. The team that possesses the ball for a majority of passes (Opta’s definition) during any given match also tends to earn more scoring attempts than its opponent. So far I’ve bored you with support for conventional wisdom: possession coincides with more scoring opportunities, and thus probably with better results. But then I control for a few variables and shit goes haywire. When I control for each individual team and whether or not they were playing at home, the relationship between possession and results is <strong><em>decidedly negative</em></strong>. In fact, a team that possesses the ball an additional 10% in any given match is expected to lose half of a goal on average, equivalent to about half of a point. For example’s sake, consider the Seattle <del>Flounders</del> Sounders. Over Seattle’s top four matches in terms of possession, it has earned just one point. However, during Seattle’s bottom four matches in terms of possession, it has earned eight points. Seattle is an extreme case, but a good example of what my model is picking up. Most teams individually seem to do worse when their possession is higher. So more possession seems to correlate with more shots, and more shots seems to correlate with more goals, but for some reason more possession does not share a significant relationship with more goals. There is some missing information screwing with me, and I don’t have a definitive explanation for this strange paradox, but I will share a theory. Each team has a style. Whether or not that style works is probably mostly a product of how well the players fit in, and how good those players are in the first place. Perhaps, in general, a style that focuses more on stringing short passes together tends to produce more shots than a high-risk/high-reward style, but this type of possession is not a necessary condition for success. Once each team develops its style, a certain amount of possession is required to optimize that style. For Montreal, it may be 49% possession, and for Portland, it might be 57%. This would explain the mild positive correlations between possession and shots <strong><em>across teams</em></strong>. But why is it that, <strong><em>across games</em></strong>, more possession seems to correspond to less goals and worse results? In a given game, if a team generates more possession—more passing by Opta’s definition—then perhaps that is indicative more of the opponent’s defense than of the desire of the team in question to possess. In other words, an excellent defense may not necessarily kill possession, but rather, push possession to less dangerous parts of the pitch. In this way, more possession is simply indicative of a frustrated team, not a team in control doing what it wants to do. Without being able to conclude this thought exercise satisfyingly, I will propose a few things. First, that by charting each shot’s point of origin, we can begin to assess the quality of a team’s shots. And second, that possession data should be gathered from the distinct areas on the pitch. Possession in the attacking third is likely more valuable than possession in the defensive third. Some combination of these two measurements could very well help to explain the paradox we’re seeing with passing possession and team success. *A perfect positive correlation would be&nbsp;1.0.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/juan-agudelo-new-england/">New England Revolution Acquire Juan Agudelo, What Does That Mean?</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>First things first before I make fun of the Revolution (and I will).  Their defense has been—-excluding the New York outlier—-borderline elite this season. That’s possibly one of the few reasons they’re still afloat and maybe the only reason to watch them (sorry, Lee Nguyen).  <a href="http://tempofreesoccer.blogspot.com/">Tempo-free soccer</a> has the Revs ranked 6<span class="ord">th</span> in dAG (defensive attempts on goals), which is how many times an opposing team has made any attempt at their goal. Add to that that we have them ranked 2<span class="ord">nd</span> (6.2%) in Opposing Finishing%, which is how often a team’s opponents successfully convert attempts into actual goals. They’re better than every team outside of Montreal in that category. This has all culminated in only 6 goals allowed in 9 games. Something that would be overlooked if it wasn’t for their horrible attack and the need for at least some positive mention. But now the Revs have added the young (former starlett?) Juan Agudelo, someone who saw time with the <span class="caps">US</span> National team only 6 months ago in Russia and didn’t look awful by any stretch. To be fair, he’s someone that has actually come out looking very strong for Chivas earlier this season, but he’s been hampered the last few weeks with hamstring issues. It was thought that he had mended a brewing off-season situation between himself and Chivas USA head coach, El Chelis. But of late, Chelis has given a lot of credit to his now former striker. He told <a href="http://www.cdchivasusa.com/news/2013/03/chelis-admits-i-didnt-know-what-i-had-juan-agudelo">MLSSoccer</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I didn’t know what I had in Agudelo, but by having him, what I asked for doesn’t matter because Agudelo is a model. He is the natural on this team. He’s a player that has many technical qualities. He’s very involved in working to improve&nbsp;others.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now he’s shipped off to the greater Boston area and <del>we are with out the full detail of the acquisition being yet to be vented </del> in exchange the Goats received <strong><a href="http://www.sounderatheart.com/2012/12/23/3797066/allocation-money">allocation money</a></strong>. The spice of life and magic dust that no one talks about and everyone wants. Of course for us this isn’t about the details at this point. What Juan Agudelo will bring is spectacular things and then all together frustrating things. He averages about 16 shots on goal per 1500 minutes, a number he has yet to reach in either of his stops in Chivas or New York. A team averages a goal on 9.4% of its attempts this season, and 26.9% of its shots on goal. Using that, there’s a possibility that he adds a few additional goals to the line-up. Assuming he is just average at finishing. That said Agudelo has beat the average ratio over his 3,000 minutes, scoring 11 goals in 36 shots on goal (30.6%). Scoring goals is a skill, and though we don’t know how much is luck vs. his ability, I think it’s very possible that he will continue to beat the league average conversion rates. Looking at <strong>Chris Wondolowski</strong>, <strong>Kenny Cooper</strong> and <strong>Álvaro Saborío</strong>&#8211;the top 3 scorers for 2012—they all combined to beat the league average by scoring a goal on 43.9% of their shots on target. So, we can safely attribute scoring goals on shots on target as being a skill, the only problem is trying to account for luck. That’s a little difficult at this stage, and so for now, we’ll just mention it. But assuming that Agudelo is consistent and continues scoring at a high rate and matches 1500 minutes. I have him for about 6 goals this season. Right now considering their goal conversion and their already abysmal offense, the Revs are on pace for 36 goals total to end the season. Considering their ability to suppress their opponent’s talent and ability to score goals I have them for 26 goals allowed, assuming they continue their defensive supremacy. Using <a href="http://www.soccermetrics.net/soccer-pythagorean-theory/new-soccer-pythagorean-api-call">SoccerMetricsPythagorean</a> this comes out at about 51 points… given the asinine goal difference. Add in the additional 6 goals that Juan Agudelo brings and that brings them to a total of 56. Basically almost a full point for each goal. Now, I’m not about to say that the Revolution have a shot at 60 points, not in your life. But in the last 3 years the only teams to have a plus goal differential <span class="caps">AND</span> not make the playoffs were 2011 Chicago Fire and the 2010 Kansas City Wizards. Considering a team-wide return to a league-average ability to score goals AND adding Juan Agudelo, it’s very possible that New England just moved themselves within striking distance for the 4<span class="ord">th</span> or 5<span class="ord">th</span> spot in the East. Columbus and Philly,&nbsp;beware.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/houston-dynamo-la-galaxy/">Game of the Week Recap: Dynamo at Galaxy</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>The Los Angeles Galaxy’s Landon Donovan blew a <span class="caps">PK</span> in the 25<span class="ord">th</span> minute, and the Houston Dynamo managed a goal in the 56<span class="ord">th</span>, stealing three points in LA. Definitely not what our expert panel of misfits projected on <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/05/05/asa-podcast-episode-five/">Saturday’s podcast</a>.  The Galaxy controlled possession (59.3%), won more duels (55%), and earned more attempts (19 to 14), but earned nothing in the standings for its work. Here’s a chronological summary of Houston’s shots:  <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/houston-dynamo-shot-times-may-5-2013.png" alt="Houston Dynamo shot times - May 5 2013"> There are actually two shots taken in succession there before Houston’s opponent missed a <span class="caps">PK</span>, but the disproportionate bulk of Houston’s shots, including its goal, still came after it almost went down 1-0. That’s probably just random, but interesting nonetheless. Here’s something that’s almost surely not random. Though the Galaxy won the attempts battle, many of those attempts were blocked, and many of those blocked attempts occurred after Houston took the lead. Observe: <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/la-galaxys-blocked-shot-times-may-5-2013.png" alt="LA Galaxy&#39;s blocked shot times - May 5 2013"> It seems the Galaxy began to get desperate, and this brings up the concept of game states which we discussed in the above podcast. Teams are likely to employ different strategies depending on the score of the game. While the Galaxy out-attempted the Dynamo during the game, many of those attempts appear to have been of the low-probability type. The Dynamo jumped up to third in points per game, and the updated tables can now be seen <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/">here</a>! <em>*Thanks to <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2013-05-05-LA-v-HOU/chalkboard">Opta and <span class="caps">MLS</span> Soccer</a> for the sweet&nbsp;images!</em></p>
