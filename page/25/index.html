          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This was suppose to be a quick 15-to-20-minute podcast that turned into an almost 52-minute single segment ramble about all things <span class="caps">US</span> in the past week. It was just Drew and I, covering just about everything conceivable over the course of the loss to Costa Rica on the road to the win in Columbus against Mexico. No spoilers; just have a listen. [audio <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/asa-episode-xxi.mp3">http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/asa-episode-xxi.mp3</a>] <em>*Editors note:</em> <em>Matthias to Drew by text after <span class="caps">CR</span>’s second goal: [Howard didn’t look ready for that one. I think he could have done more.]</em> <em>Matthias to Drew by text after <span class="caps">CR</span>’s third goal: [The defender definitely got beat, but the Costa Rican player didn’t even get to the ball until it was 23 yards out. That’s Howard’s ball. </em> <em>Drew on Podcast: “…and Matthias was texting me…Matthias was like ‘what’s he doing in there? These goals are all his fault.’ “</em> <em>In a private interview with the Matthias, the editor was assured that Matthias never thought the goals were 100% Howard’s fault, as Matthias—-a student of probability—-rarely believes anything is 100%.</em> <em>Oh, and Drew is a poophead. </em>   <em>**Editors note part 2:</em> <em>Matthias edited is the editor of the site, just in case you didn’t realize&nbsp;that.</em></p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/colorados-playoff-chances/">Colorado's Playoff Chances.</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>A few short months ago, we recorded <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/06/01/mls-soccer-podcast/">a podcast</a> in which we discussed the teams likely to make the playoffs in the Western Conference. At the time, we did not think Colorado would get in, but now—-after a surprising win in Los Angeles—-the Rapids find themselves very much in the thick of the playoff race. As of May 31<span class="ord">st</span>, Colorado had earned 19 points from 13 games and sat in 5<span class="ord">th</span> place out west. Additionally, the Rapids’ 1.03 attempts ratio was 6<span class="ord">th</span> in the conference, while our shot locations data suggested an expected goal differential essentially tied for 4<span class="ord">th</span>. Perhaps we shouldn’t have discarded them so quickly. Now with more information, we’ve seen how shot ratios help to predict the future as well as anything in soccer. The predictions aren’t awesome, but better than if we were to use goal differential or standings. Colorado has found itself <em><strong>still</strong></em> in playoff contention, and I think it is worth revisiting the playoff chances for the Western Conference’s mile-high team. Now, 28 weeks into the season, Colorado has improved its shots ratios and expected goal differential to <strong><em>second in the conference</em></strong>, just behind the Galaxy on both accounts. But while Colorado could very well be one of the top teams in the West, its remaining schedule is pretty brutal. Of its last six matches, five of them come against Dallas, Portland, San Jose and Vancouver (twice). Those are the four teams fighting along with the Rapids for the final two playoff spots. The other game on their schedule just so happens to be Seattle, the current favorite to win the Supporters’ Shield. There is not a single cupcake on the schedule, and losses will be far more costly than if they were against Eastern Conference foes. While the best predictions using shots data still leaves much to be desired, that data would in fact pick Colorado as the second best team in the West. However, playing a tough schedule against opponents shooting for the same playoff spot, there is so much weight on just a few games. I’d pick Colorado to be one of those top five in the tables at the end, but it’s not a gimme pick. Let’s say, ooooh,&nbsp;55%.</p>

<p>We moved days! We’ll be getting the podcast to you Thursday night/Friday morning from here on out. You know, rather than getting it to you on Sunday after all the weekends games have been played. If nothing else, it should give you something great* to hear on your way to the match. This episode, we devote our second segment to talking about the <span class="caps">MLS</span> Front offices and geeks vs. nerds, and then we also touch on women in the front office as well as in the coaches’ boxes. Among other things we play a couple of silly games and then, of course, talk random news and notes for the past week. Hope you enjoy!
