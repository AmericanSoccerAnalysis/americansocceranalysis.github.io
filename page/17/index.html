          <section class="content"><p>Last week, we talked about <span class="caps">PDO</span>…a lot. We likely will continue to talk about PDO and monitor it through the season. After games played this past weekend here are the up-to-date rankings. I know that Matthias usually just updates his page on Monday, but I’m actually going to make these a post so that when I want to do a week-by-week investigation later on this off-season, it saves me time. Because it’s all about&nbsp;me. </p>

If you’re trying to figure out what to look at, there are a couple of things that may, possibly, <em>jump</em> out at you. The first being the New England Revolution sandwiched between the two best teams in <span class="caps">MLS</span>, Portland and Montreal. Admittedly, the club has been on a sort of hot streak but it a large percentage of their PDO comes from the lack of goals they’ve conceded. Opposing clubs have the worst conversion rate of Goals/Shots against New England. Similarly, you see Sporting Kansas City sitting 15<span class="ord">th</span> in PDO and can’t help but be a little bit scared of what could come in the second half should there be positive regression. Considering all the head scratching that the media and supporters have concerning Seattle’s early exploits, Sporting has gone largely unnoticed with an underwhelming start. Yet, the <a href="http://11tegen11.net/2012/12/01/introducing-the-relative-shots-rate/"><span class="caps">TSR</span></a> (explanation linked—we’ll get into this more down the road) is very much there and so are the points. An interesting out come for a club that (deservedly) had the hype machine cranked to full. Oh, and <span class="caps">DC</span> United is definitely still a combination bad and unlucky. Sorry,&nbsp;Drew.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/possession-confusion-update/">Possession Confusion Update</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p><a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/possession-confusion/">I wrote back in May</a> about the paradoxical nature of <span class="caps">OPTA</span>’s possession statistic in MLS—-how more possession corresponds to better shot ratios, better shot ratios correspond to better goal differentials, but somehow more possession does not correspond to better goal differentials when we control for certain variables. In fact, I found that once I controlled for the teams playing in a given game, possession had a negative correlation with goal differential and winning. The new data agrees with the old. Correlations suggest that team possession still correlates positively with scoring attempts (p-value = 0.01), scoring attempts still correlate positively to goal differential (p-value = 0.02), and now with more data, possession is also positively correlated to goal differential (p-value = 0.01). That all seems to line up with logic, but the paradox from before still exists. When I look game-by-game and control for the home and away teams, in-game possession has a positive correlation to shot ratio, <em><strong>but a negative correlation</strong></em> to goal differential. In other words, the team that has more possession in a given game tends to also earn more shot attempts, but still loses more frequently than we would expect. As mentioned in the first article back in May, this seems paradoxical. I had some theories in that article, but reader David Stringer <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/possession-confusion/#comments">got me to think about</a> another logical explanation. Teams that develop leads tend to sit back more defensively, and often are satisfied allowing the opponent to possess all it wants in less dangerous parts of the pitch. A team that has a lead in the second half probably  got that lead because it was generating more opportunities (read: attempts). It makes sense that the team that eventually went on to win also produced better shot ratios early on before getting the lead. After getting the lead, the team in front was willing to give up extreme possession relative to a more neutral shot rate. Thus it ends the game with poor possession, but a still favorable shot rate. Just a theory, and I’d love to hear about other ideas! The stats are definitely not lying. These correlations are very real, but the causes for the possession paradox are still&nbsp;elusive.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/pdo-mls-soccer/">A little information on: PDO</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>With the holiday behind us we can once again start to return to the business at hand. The half-way mark is upon us and <span class="caps">MLS</span> has given us an exciting and very tight race across both the Western and Eastern conferences. With that comes another week of podcasts. #AnalysisEvolved. This week we plan on talking a bit about a statistic by the name PDO. Unlike how you might imagine most statistic names coming about, or things with three random letters, this is not an acronym. It’s pronounced how it’s sounds. Originally a hockey metric, PDO is simply the sum of save percentage and scoring percentage, then multiplied times 1000. The rest of the history as it applies to soccer isn’t necessarily important. A great introduction to the idea and how it applies to the sport is given by <a href="http://www.mc79hockey.com/?p=2996">Tyler Dellow of mc79hockey.com</a>, and there is another introduction on the site <a href="http://www.pensionplanpuppets.com/2010/6/1/1495214/advanced-team-stats-what-the-heck">Pension Plan Puppet</a> by one “Skinny Fish.” Both sites give examples of how <span class="caps">PDO</span> can potentially isolate a team’s performance over the course of a season and compare those to past performances, various incarnations of the team, and of course, other teams. <del>I can’t directly attribute who was the first to apply the team analysis to the sport of soccer</del>(Grayson confirmed he was the first…). But the oldest article I can find referencing its usage within the sport comes from the ever-smart and sophisticated <del>Canuck</del>, James Grayson. His series of introductions to the metric is linked below. <a href="http://jameswgrayson.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/a-primer-pdo/">A Premier: <span class="caps">PDO</span></a> <a href="http://jameswgrayson.wordpress.com/2011/04/05/pdo-part-i/"><span class="caps">PDO</span> – part I</a> <a href="http://jameswgrayson.wordpress.com/2011/04/15/pdo-part-ii/"><span class="caps">PDO</span> – part II</a> Along with an explanation of the stat and some information about how it regresses to the mean—-because it’s fantastic at doing that—-there is also a bit of information about how it can be used to compare different clubs to one another. Basically, it comes down to being one of the best methods to determine the barometer of a team. While we can look at point totals and standings in the table, <span class="caps">PDO</span> can reasonably tell us if a team is over performing or under performing. I’m not in any way an expert on this stat. There are of course some occasions were you may run into issues with trying to apply it to a specific scenario, and I could point anyone in search of more answers on the subject in better directions than toward myself. I could easily name about a dozen or so people that are much more versed in this metric than I am. However, since we were going to take about it on our podcast this weekend, I wanted to give the reader/listener an opportunity to find some quick and easy references to the material before hearing us talk about it this weekend. I’ll have an updated PDO standings for you all tomorrow which will lead into our discussions on&nbsp;Saturday.</p>
