<p>The site is largely undone and a lot of is in need of love. But that will come in time and as we have time to get to it. Until those moments arrive and in effort to hold you off, here is episode 1 of our podcast. It’s a bit rough and it’s the first time either of us have done this so be easy. Things will get better. Right now, podcasts record on Saturdays and will be released sometime Sunday or Monday with a running time of roughly 30 minutes. Enjoy!

          <section class="content"><p>We’re here, we’re loud, we’re here to make a difference. There is a lot to be said within the world of soccer or “futbol”, especially when concerning analysis and analytics. Using what is available is kind of the name of the game. But the thing about American Soccer is that more than ever there is a lot out there that allows for—in the very least—a better way of achieving a whole picture. None of us here have the answers, nor do any of us think we’re going to come up with them. But there are a lot of smart people out there that sometimes go without being heard and our self proclaimed job is finding those people and try to give them a voice and have some fun doing it. We’re going to do a lot of things wrong, moreso than right. That’s cool. You’re going to make mistakes. The point in that is that you make the public you show what you…or we… did wrong and you show you correct or fix that mistake. Giving the process some transparency. Something sorely lacking in American Soccer and Analytics within the beautiful game. For now this is just a site to host our podcasts and generally collect the little bits of wisdom that we’ve scoured the internet for. If you have find something good give me a&nbsp;shout.</p>
