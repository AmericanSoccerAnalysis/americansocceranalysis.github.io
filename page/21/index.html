            <h2><a href="/articles/game-states-an-introduction/">Game States: An Attempt at an Introduction</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I’m no mathematician. Matty maybe, but I am not. So when approaching something like Game States, I felt it good to attempt to introduce it with something, though it’s rather ominous and a bit intimidating. So most—if not all—of the information provided is taken from a source who is smarter than I am. That’s really what this blog is all about, finding people who know and understand the principles we are trying to learn and centralize the material and keep it in tidy location where people that are new—-not just to the sport, but also the concept of analytics—-can go to find information and grow their knowledge.  <a href="http://www.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~sklar/teaching/s09/cis3.5/hw/labIII.3.pdf">The idea of game states</a> is that a match will consist of a sequence of states, where each state is defined by a combination or series of events that culminate in creating a new state. Those events give details and help break down the match. They provide context or meaning to the data that we record. Game states, as I understand it, is based upon the idea of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov Chains</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>…[A] mathematical system that undergoes transitions from one state to another, between a finite or countable number of possible states. It is a random process usually characterized as memoryless: the next state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded&nbsp;it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s apply this idea to a&nbsp;sport…</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In football, if a team is in a certain situation, what happened previously has no effect on what will happen next. For example, if we have a 1<span class="ord">st</span>-and-10 from our own 20, it does not matter if the previous play was a kickoff for a touchback or a 10-yard gain for a first down after a 3<span class="ord">rd</span>-and-10 from the 10-yardline. Either way, we now have a new situation that will only directly affect the next&nbsp;play.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To put it all into soccer terminology, if a team has possession of the ball and is progressing past the half-line and into the attacking third it doesn’t matter if they got it on an interception or a goal kick. Regardless of how it happened they now have the ball going into the oppositions attacking third and will have an opportunity to threaten and score. I struggle with this thought because tactically this may not be true—-an individual getting the ball on a break is different than someone participating with a soft building of play in attacking the opposition’s net. Coming from a statistical and memory-less position we simply want the facts. Let’s go to another sport and put this into baseball terms because of the advanced progress that the sport in general has made in analytics. Baseball analytics breaks game states down into four basic concepts: <strong>the score, inning, base runners and outs</strong>. This would be the way you could <a href="http://www.lookoutlanding.com/2010/2/14/1310724/sabremetrics-101-the-game-state">calculate basic run/win expectancy and ratios</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If you have the average number of runs expected to score in an inning after any game state, you can figure out how many runs a stolen base is worth, or a triple, or a strikeout. The game state essentially allows us to relate everything that happens on the diamond back to the major currencies of baseball: winning and&nbsp;runs.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’re not talking about baseball. We’re talking about soccer, or for you euro snobs, ‘Fútbol’. However, taking the concepts of an already practically applied matrix, such as baseball and the one that that <a href="http://www.tangotiger.net/RE9902.html">Tom Tango has already developed(see below),</a> can give us ideas on how we can attempt to create a corresponding one in soccer. Soccer has <strong>wins</strong> too—-though I see more people associate points—-but our true currency in this sport is <strong>goals</strong>. Everything leads back to the price or value of a goal. Whether it be a cross or a tackle, the ultimate result of what we want is to be able to understand how things work together to produce goals.Comparing the possible game states; Soccer just—just like in baseball—has a score line that can help give us an idea of the transitions between states. A team being up one goal, or on the other side of the coin being down one goal, can give us a definition of a game state. It’s simplistic, but it works. It also can show us why some times, looking at you Alex Fergueson, teams take less shots than at other times. It would make sense just for the purpose of proper possession. We also have measurement for the length of the game, in that each team will play against one another for a total of 90 minutes. In soccer, we have <strong>time intervals</strong>. The largest problem is that because it’s constantly moving rather than a set static state, such as an inning, it creates a lot of various probabilities and chains. However, if you wanted to mitigate that to an extent you could instead just revert to the basics of using the first half vs. the second half of a match. While these are two big time intervals, when used in conjunction with other specific game states it could continue to help us develop a better understanding of the game. The next one listed is base runners, but I’m going to pass on that and move on to the concept of <strong>outs</strong>. This is something that at very best I can say is a difficult correlation, but if you wanted to attempt one I might try changes in possession. This is a rather poor concept and I have no idea how or if you want to use this… probably not. Baseball limits a team to three attempts to score per their half of the inning rather than having 3 specific possessions or attempts to score. In the first 45 minutes of a half you could have a team with anywhere between 12 and 40 possessions alone depending on who the opponent was and how the team executed its attack. Back to <strong>base runners,</strong> and this is one of the easier things to mimic though I have no way of proving how closely they are related. Shots on goal  conceivably could give us a baseline on the probability of goal scored and, more importantly, the points that are associated with winning or drawing. One additional game state that hasn’t been mentioned and doesn’t really correlate with anything that baseball has, is <strong>yellow and red cards</strong>. While, baseball has ejections it doesn’t necessarily affect the dimensions of the game. However, in soccer it puts the team down a man, rather than being able to just sub in a replacement. These are all elements which you would consider <em>context</em>. How do teams perform during these situations? Do their possessions last longer? Do they take more shots? What are the quality of shots? This is the information and really the purpose behind gathering the data points. Are the Seattle Sounders just as likely to score in a “-1” goal situation as they are in a tie-game? This is all information that we are seeking. The context can provide further details as well as specific entry into how certain aspects and statistics can be properly correlated to goals, and then to points toward the table. I feel like there is more to write about here… and that’s because it’s true. There is a lot more to write about. But this is primarily to cover the basics of game states. We’ll talk more about it in our podcast tomorrow, and we’ll have a follow up post to everything when we start preparing to post <span class="caps">MLS</span> game state&nbsp;information.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/now-a-thought-on-big-data-and-club-analyst/">Now, A Thought On Big Data And Club Analysis</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I talked a bit about Big vs. Small data last week—in case you missed it, <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/data-big-vs-small/">go back and check it out</a>&#8211;and we kind of talked about how you don’t have to necessarily rely on the revolution of big data. There is a need to make do with what is currently available. However, for many clubs overseas that big data is available, but there are other encumbrances to deal&nbsp;with: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond the complexity and time constraints placed on the analysis, another major obstacle faced in the job – like that faced by so many people entrusted with big data within an organisation, football club or otherwise – is to make data useful, accessible and engaging to colleagues who have little interest or experience in dealing with&nbsp;numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This from a recent<a href="http://www.thebigdatainsightgroup.com/site/article/ben-smith-development-performance-systems-chelsea-fc"> interview with Ben Smith of the development performance systems at Chelsea <span class="caps">FC</span></a>. A club that is often quoted as one of the “big-4” in the English Premier League. It’s important to understand that, while many of these clubs have information at their disposal, few (if any) know or understand the practicality of implementing the information into their planning and preparation phase. If fact, reading back on the ‘Counter Attack’ blog by Richard Whittal, some clubs—i.e. most— <a href="/articles/now-a-thought-on-big-data-and-club-analyst/even%20pay%20<span class="ord">th</span>eir%20club%20analysts">don’t pay their club analysts</a>. That should give you a brief, if not all together insulting, view of how much they respect the value of the service provided. I’m not saying they don’t see it as useful in “some capacity”, I just think that, in terms of how much they pay the rest of the staff, they could afford to have a full time analyst, especially for what an analyst has the potential to&nbsp;provide. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>But it is not, of course, just the coaching and scouting staff that benefit from the big data analytics being carried out at the club, the players are also reaping the rewards of the work across the club. He says: “Every one of Chelsea’s Academy players from the age of nine has a personalised development&nbsp;programme.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is some interesting stuff here to think about. It sounds a lot like how <a href="https://twitter.com/analyseFooty">Ravi Ramineni</a> has started helping out David Tenney, Sounders <span class="caps">FC</span> fitness coach, over the past 6-8 months. By the way, h/t goes to Ravi who linked the article from his&nbsp;twitter.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/game-of-the-week-recap-new-england-revolution-vs-philadaelphia-union/">Game Of The Week Recap: New England Revolution vs. Philadaelphia Union</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>It’s Monday morning! Hope you’ve had your coffee, been to your morning meetings and are ready to catch up on the <span class="caps">MLS</span> weekend. We’re not probably at the point to where we’re going to review games or teams on a consistent basis. That’s not really our thing… at least, not yet. But Saturday on the most recent podcast, Matty and I talked about our game of the week, featuring the New England Revolution at home versus a high powered Philadelphia attack. The Union boys are a club that, in general, doesn’t keep possession long, nor win it back. But they rely specifically on creating as many chances as possible and finishing the ones they are supposed too. It’s partially why they are an improved club this year and one that has a legit chance to get into the playoffs and do some damage in the East. They were coming up against a New England team that averaged less ball possession, won the ball back less and took a whole lot less shots—-and the Revolution was even allowing its opponents twice as many opportunities as it earned for itself. What it came down to was that Philly was a borderline good team that sat near mid-table, and New England was arguably one of the worst-seeded among those in the bottom. The surprising thing, and partly what made us choose this game as our game of the week, was simply how split the analysts were at MLSsoccer.com. Two were for a draw, two for a Union win, and two had the Rev’s with a win. All the way around it was kind of an interesting match-up of a slumping team against a club that seemed to be on it’s way up. If you didn’t hear the podcast, I had the Union 2-1, and Matty went even further with a 2-0 Union beating on the road in Foxborough. Both of us look a little silly this morning with the Revolution pulling out the win. So, how exactly did this band of struggling MLS misfits steal 3-points? Simple, they finally took and finished shots. The first capture below is the Revs and their chances created in the attacking third. This is shots, key passes and corner kicks and successful free-kicks leading to&nbsp;attempts. </p>
<p><img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/revsattackingthird-20130427.jpeg?w=300" alt="RevsAttackingThird-20130427"></p>
<p>The next shot is clearances, interceptions, recoveries, tackles, blocks, saves and punches made by the the keeper/back defensive four of the Union inside their own box… it’s kind of a&nbsp;mess.</p>
<p><img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/uniond-201304271.jpeg?w=300" alt="UnionD-20130427"></p>
<p>The bottom line is that for the first time, possibly all season, the Revolution were dangerous on the attack and they not only put shots on target, they legitimately tested the opposing defense. Then, once they had a lead, they allowed their strong defense to carry them home for the full 3&nbsp;points.</p>
<p>Almost as convicting, the Union were only able to create 6 real attempts on goal in the second half and only 4 after the Rev’s finally broke the stalemate. While they weren’t bad on the attacking end, it just simply didn’t match what the home team was accomplishing, and it left Philly out points at the end of the&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>I think this sort of game underlines the amount of parity that is in this league right now and also the fact that you have to consider a team’s incredibly poor finishing rate as <strong>not</strong> being an indication of true talent—-at least, not this early in the season. New England basically out-Union’d the Union, by beating them while playing their own style of play on the pitch. Overwhelming them with shots and finishing opportunities. Both teams will face exceptionally tough tasks by playing Northwest clubs (Portland and Seattle, respectively) next week, and it should be interesting to see what comes of&nbsp;it.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/montreals-paradox/">Montreals Paradox</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>If you have listened to our podcasts or read through our stuff, you will have heard us talk about shot ratios a lot. That’s how many shots a team gets divided by how many shots its allows its opponents. A shot ratio of 1.5, for example, means that a team gets one-and-a-half times as many shots as its opponents. When soccer teams create extra opportunities for themselves, it generally leads to more goals and more points in the standings. And then there’s Montreal. The Montreal Impact has been something of a Cinderella story this season, at least statistically. Leading up to its matchup with the Chicago Fire on Saturday, the Impact had recorded the <strong><em>second-worst</em></strong> shot attempt ratio in the entire league. Montreal had earned just 61 shot attempts with 28 on target to its opponents’ 95 shot attempts with 32 on target.  Yet somehow, the Impact had maintained a positive goal differential (+2) and the second-most points per match right behind <span class="caps">FC</span> Dallas. Against Chicago, Montreal not only won on the scoreboard two-nil, it also won the shooting and possession battles. But that is a rare feat this year for the Impact, and it’s worth posing the question: Has Montreal been lucky this season, or does it do things that shot ratios and possession just can’t explain? Using just <strong><em>shots on goal</em></strong> for now, I regressed goal scoring ratios against shot ratios to see how teams “should do,” as if shots on goal were the only thing that matter. Even this early in the season, the regression was not all that bad (R2 = 0.4). It also said that Montreal’s 0.94 <em>shot</em> ratio should lead to about the same <em>goal</em> ratio.<em> Well that makes sense. If you generate roughly the same number of shots on target as your opponents, you should score about the same number of goals. The Impact, however, have scored nine goals to its opponents’ five—a 1.8 ratio, or +4 differential, if you prefer. An obvious thing to consider is finishing rate. Despite being outshot, the Impact players finish their attempts with goals <em>*<em>more than twice as efficiently </em></em></em>as opponents do. That ratio is the best in the league. My first instinct is that the Impact has been somewhat lucky, and that opponents will start to finish with more frequency. But there are two possible explanations I want to explore first before waving the cliché luck flag: the quality of opportunities for Montreal and the quality of opportunities for its opponents. Harrison talked a little bit about Montreal’s counter-attacking style during a recent podcast, and there’s a possibility that the Impact’s style allows low-quality opportunities to its opponents, leading to higher-percentage opportunities for itself on the counter attack. (Before we investigate, it should be noted that Montreal’s schedule has featured teams that average out to be, well, league-average when it comes to finishing.) Let’s take Saturday’s match against the Fire as an example of the tools I’m using. Check out the Opta chalkboard for yourself <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2013-04-27-MTL-v-CHI/chalkboard">here</a>, and you can see from where teams are shooting and scoring by clicking the appropriate boxes for team and statistic of interest. During this particular game, I have Montreal down for 16 scoring attempts, nine from outside the box, six inside, and one from right on the edge. Both its goals were scored from inside the box (though you could argue one was one the edge). Chicago, on the other hand, earned 11 attempts, ripping seven of those from outside the box, just two from inside, and two from the edge of the box. Chicago did not score. I did this for each of Montreal’s seven games this season. Obviously things like angle matter, too, but I’m not going to pull out my protractor for this one. Here’s the breakdown for Montreal and its opponents on the&nbsp;season: </p>
<p><em>Attempts</em>
<em>Goals</em>
<em>Finishing</em></p>
<p><strong>Stat</strong>
<strong>Montreal</strong>
<strong>Opponents</strong>
<strong>Montreal</strong>
<strong>Opponents</strong>
<strong>Montreal</strong>
<strong>Opponents</strong></p>
<p>Inside&nbsp;Box</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>15.0%</p>
<p>8.9%</p>
<p>Outside&nbsp;Box</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>9.7%</p>
<p>1.8%</p>
<p>On&nbsp;Edge</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>0</p>
<p>0</p>
<p>0.0%</p>
<p>0.0%</p>
<p><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p><strong>77</strong></p>
<p><strong>106</strong></p>
<p><strong>9</strong></p>
<p><strong>5</strong></p>
<p><strong>11.7%</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.7%</strong></p>
<p>  Montreal earns more shots inside the box than outside, and that might very well be a product of its system and players, rather than just dumb luck. While the Impact is being outshot in total, perhaps that stat is skewed slightly by shot selection. Montreal’s system seems to create a greater proportion of opportunities in the box. I would still expect some regression from Montreal this season back toward the middle of the standings—as its shot ratios are not favorable even after adjusting for quality—but perhaps not as far as a simple shot model would&nbsp;suggest.</p>
