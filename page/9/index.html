            <h2><a href="/articles/jamison-olaves-value-to-new-york/">Jamison Olave's Value to New York</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>There was quite a popular tweet from a canine about New York’s improved play this season when Jamison Olave was playing. <a href="https://twitter.com/GothamistDan/status/397398611438608384">https://twitter.com/GothamistDan/status/397398611438608384</a> There are obviously confounding factors at play here, not to mention small sample sizes. There were only seven matches this season in which Olave did not start, and eight in which he played 45 minutes or less. Any data obtained from these games is going to be subject to A) small sample sizes, B) lots of variance in the response variable (goals or wins), and C) no control for quality of opponent or location of the match. To deal with the small sample size/variance problem, I’m going to use our now <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/shot-locations/team-by-team-shot-locations/">semi-famous data set</a> on shot location origins. Steven Fenn kindly <a href="http://theshinguardian.com/2013/10/31/mls-playoff-ball-who-are-the-belles/">showed the world</a> their predictive value, and to me that means that expected goals for and against are the most stable stat available for such an analysis. To control for New York’s opponents—-when Olave was both in and out of the starting <span class="caps">XI</span>—-I have included each of New York’s opponent’s expected goals data in the linear regression, while also accounting for whether or not the Red Bulls were at home. Blah, blah, blah, to the results! Looking at the defensive side, New York allowed shots leading to 0.24 fewer expected goals against in games that Olave started. That seems to indicate New York’s need for Olave, but the p-value was a kind-of-high 26 percent. Overall, New York’s expected goal differential climbed 0.19 goals in those games that Olave started, though again, the p-value was quite high at 46 percent.<em> Now for your shitty conclusion, courtesy of shitty p-values: Olave’s influence on New York’s level of play this season was questionable. There is some suggestion that he helped reduce goal-scoring against, however there is a reasonable chance that that difference was due to other, not-measured-here variables. What I am more comfortable claiming is that he does <em><strong>not</strong></em> make a 0.86-goal difference on the defensive side. The point is this. New York’s shot creation and goal scoring ability, for and against, are more a function of whether or not the Red Bulls are home, and against whom they are playing. Not as much whether Olave starts. Obviously putting an inferior player into the starting <span class="caps">XI</span> isn’t going to help New York out. But, as I always question, do we really know how to value soccer players at all? Maybe Olave just doesn’t make that much of a difference. After all, he’s only one of eleven players. _</em>For those curious, the number of minutes Olave played was a worse predictor variable than the simple binary variable of whether or not he started. Controlling for the strength of opponent was necessary since perhaps Mr. Petke was more likely to sit Olave against a worse opponent at home, or something like&nbsp;that._</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/rosales-not-dempsey-is-the-clear-choice-for-seattles-set-piece-crosses/">Rosales, not Dempsey, is the clear choice for Seattle's set-piece crosses</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>In Seattle’s 2-1 loss to Portland on Saturday, Clint Dempsey took all of the Sounders’ attacking set-pieces in the first half. He was impressive with his free kick shots on goal, clipping the crossbar and forcing Donovan Ricketts into multiple saves. But his corner kicks left much to be desired. Mauro Rosales subbed on in the 63<span class="ord">rd</span> minute and took the remainder of the set-piece crosses and created more chances. With Lamar Neagle suspended for yellow card accumulation and Seattle needing goals in leg two, Rosales seems likely to start. Requisite warning about small sample sizes aside, based off of the results in leg one, the data suggest Sigi Schmidt would be wise to let Rosales take over set-piece crossing duties in the second leg. Here’s how Dempsey’s nine corners and one free kick cross went in leg one: <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/dempseyleg1fks.jpg?w=300" alt="DempseyLeg1FKs"> 3<span class="ord">rd</span> minute corner: To the near post, cleared by Diego Chara 6<span class="ord">th</span> corner: Near post, cleared by Will Johnson 20<span class="ord">th</span> corner: Near post, cleared by Will Johnson 25<span class="ord">th</span> corner: Near post, cleared by Chara 32<span class="ord">nd</span> corner: Near post, cleared by Chara 38<span class="ord">th</span> corner: Top of the six yard box, cleared by Pa-Moudou Kah 38<span class="ord">th</span> corner: Top of six, cleared by Kah 39<span class="ord">th</span> free kick: Cross from 18 yards out on the wing to the top of the six, cleared by Futty Danso 45<span class="ord">th</span> corner: Near post, punched clear by Ricketts In the second half, Rosales took all three Seattle corners and two free kick crosses: <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/rosalesleg1fks.jpg?w=300" alt="RosalesLeg1FKs"> 68<span class="ord">th</span> minute corner: To the penalty spot, shot by Djimi Traore, saved by Ricketts 69<span class="ord">th</span> corner: Top of six, Headed cross by Dempsey  blocked by Zemanski and eventually caught by Ricketts 82<span class="ord">nd</span> free kick: Cross from 38 yards in the center to the penalty spot, cleared by Danso 86<span class="ord">th</span> free kick: Cross from 28 yards on the wing to the edge of the penalty box, headed by Shalrie Joseph across the box 87<span class="ord">th</span> corner: Penalty spot, Headed shot by Dempsey off of the crossbar and out In summary: Dempsey had 10 set-piece crosses, none of which reached a Seattle teammate. Rosales had five set-piece crosses, four of which found a teammate in the box, and three of which led to shots. As you can tell, it was a tale of two halves. In the first, Dempsey’s crosses rarely cleared the first defender, and none found another Sounders player. In the second half, four of Rosales’ five crosses created chances, two off of the head of Dempsey himself. If Seattle is going to win at Jeld-Wen Field on Thursday, they’ll need to do better with their crosses. Based on their chances in game one, it looks to be in the Sounders’ best interest to allow Rosales to take the free kick crosses in game two. Not only did his crosses create better chances than Dempsey in game one, but Deuce seems to be more dangerous getting on the end of crosses than he is at taking&nbsp;them.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/a-closer-look-at-the-mls-mvp-race/">A Closer Look At The MLS MVP Race</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p><em>Editor’s Note: __This was the first of many articles by <strong>Jacob</strong>, who can be found at @MLSAtheist on twitter. It’s quite amazing, and I encourage you to read it. He’s one of several wonderful writers that we are adding to the site in the coming weeks. Please give him a follow and good feedback, as you have for Drew, Matty, and me. This is all part of putting together newer, better site&nbsp;content.</em></p>
<p>Not long ago, I saw a piece on <span class="caps">ESPN</span> handicapping the MLS MVP race, featuring the one and only Alexi Lalas. Say what you will about Lalas, but what he said on this topic got my mind jogging. The season was still a couple weeks from being complete, but the Redhead tipped <strong>Marco Di Vaio</strong> over <strong>Mike Magee</strong> for the award, based mostly on his higher goal total. He explained that goals are the rarest and most important event in soccer, so the guy who scores the most (and in the most games, giving his team a better chance to win) is the best candidate for the award. But here at American Soccer Analysis, we know that just because a guy puts the final touch on a goal doesn’t necessarily make him the most valuable component of that play, let alone that&nbsp;season.</p>
<p>Anyway, Lalas had a point: goals are important. And whether you like it or not, goal scorers and creators are always going to be the award winners in this sport. But still, looking solely at goal totals seems far too simplistic when handicapping the race for <span class="caps">MVP</span>. So, as we are wont to do around here, I tried to delve a little&nbsp;deeper.</p>
<p>First of all, you can contribute to goals without being the one to actually kick it into the net. I’ll do the most obvious thing possible, and just add assists to the equation. Additionally, not every player gets to play the same amount. Especially in <span class="caps">MLS</span>, where some of the top players are constantly called away for international duty, some MVP candidates only play in two-thirds of his team’s games. But if the premise here is that the award is intended to go to the most prolific goal creator, we should really look at how many goals they create when they’re actually on the&nbsp;field.</p>
<p>Here are the ten top <span class="caps">MVP</span> candidates (I know they probably aren’t all that deserving, but ten is a good round number and I’m a little OCD), and how many goals they’ve created, as well as their per 90 minute&nbsp;rate.</p>

<p>It’s no surprise to see Keane and <strong>Camilo</strong> leading the way with over one per game, as they have the highest sum of goals and assists, and Keane did his work in fairly limited minutes. But again, goals and assists are a little too superficial for us here at <span class="caps">ASA</span>. After all, some goals are the fault of terrible defending, goalkeeping, or just some really fortunate bounces; instead it’s preferred to look at chance creation. If a player is consistently creating chances, it’s nearly inevitable that it should lead to more goals. Now rather than just the shots that actually end up in the net, we’ll run the numbers regarding shots, as well as passes that lead to shots (key passes) for the same&nbsp;players:</p>

<p>41</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>4.43</p>
<p>This time we’ve got a couple of different leaders, as <strong>Federico Higuain</strong> and Mike Magee take the lead thanks to their trigger-happy styles. Higuain’s incredible number of key passes, despite playing for a middling Crew team, should raise some eyebrows—-the dude’s an absolutely fantastic&nbsp;attacker.</p>
<p>Still, I have an issue with just looking at shots created. After all, we know not all shots are <a href="https://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/shot-locations/">created equal</a>. Without looking up the shot location data of every one of the shots in the above table, I think there’s still a way to improve the statistics: add in a factor of&nbsp;accuracy.</p>
<p>For Higuain, creating over six shots a game is terrific. But from watching a lot of Columbus games, I can tell you that plenty of those shots were low percentage bombs from 30 yards out, and plenty of others were taken by other fairly inept Crew attackers. To try to factor this in, I’d like to look at how many shots on target each player creates - the ones that actually have a chance at becoming goals. While shots on goal stats for individual players are easy to find, it’s tougher to decipher when key passes lead to shots that test keepers rather than boots into the stands. To compensate, I used each player’s team percentage of shots on target to estimate how many key passes turned into shots on goal, leading to the final following&nbsp;table:</p>

<p>2.00</p>
<p>There we have it. My endorsement for <span class="caps">MVP</span> this season, based on a combination of Alexi Lalas’ inspiration and my own twisted statistical mind, is Federico Higuain of the 16<span class="ord">th</span>-best team in the league, the Columbus&nbsp;Crew.</p>
<p>Just kidding, guys! Obviously the <span class="caps">MVP</span> debate should take more into account than who creates shots on goal. Defense, leadership, your team actually winning—-all of these things should and do matter. But still, I think this was an interesting exercise and hopefully opened at least one set of eyes to how prolific Higuain&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>Finally, a few thoughts/takeaways in bullet&nbsp;form:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higuain was held back by his team’s terrible shooting accuracy, but not as much as Graham Zusi. Now I understand why analytic folks like Sporting Kansas City’s chance creation so much, yet the team hasn’t always seen the&nbsp;results.</li>
<li>Diego Fagundez is incredibly selective about his shooting - almost 70% of his shots hit the&nbsp;target.</li>
<li>Javi Morales doesn’t shoot much for being so prolific at creating others shots. Reminds me of <a href="http://tempofreesoccer.blogspot.com/2013/09/2013-mls-top-shot-contributors.html">this post by Tempo Free Soccer</a>-—really interesting as far as categorizing attackers as shooters vs.&nbsp;providers.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>*Since Magee was traded mid-season, his season total stats were harder to find. While I used <a href="http://squawka.com/">Squawka </a>for everyone else’s stats, I ended up having to tally Magee’s game-by-game stats from <a href="http://whoscored.com/">Who Scored</a>. It’s possible that the two sites have different standards for what constitutes a shot or key pass, and that could’ve skewed the data for Magee. I’m not sure any of them look too far out of whack that I’m too suspicious, but it’s possible so I thought it should be&nbsp;noted.</em></p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/two-legged-series-probabilities/">Two-legged Series Probabilities</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>It is hard to construct probabilistic models for two-legged, home-and-home series based on a season of games that were all independent of one another (for the most part). And because our data sets from Opta and MLSsoccer.com only go back to 2011, there isn’t much of a sample size to work with come playoff time. Thus I will have to get tricky when trying to construct logical probabilities of victory in these playoff series. The first thing to point out is that our model is based on regular season games that may or may not act like two-legged playoff series. There is a common belief that the team that plays at home for the second leg has an additional advantage. However, much of that belief likely comes from people like Simon Borg, who likes <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/10/29/mls-history-gives-edge-playoff-teams-hosting-2<span class="ord">nd</span>-leg">shitting on data and the presenting it.</a> A reasonable study would need to account for the fact that the team playing at home is probably better. One such study <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=9&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CH0QFjAI&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fepub.ub.uni-muenchen.de%2F11483%2F1%2Ftr080.pdf&amp;ei=8_F_UoG0J5CgyAHM3YCIDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHVROZx2Gktc_kPVVsLvnyO5n7kWw&amp;sig2=SEZJLFcrzBg9ppqMvF1QIA&amp;bvm=bv.56146854,d.aWc">attempted to do so</a> for the <span class="caps">UEFA</span> Champion’s League, and found that the additional advantage due to hosting the second game was effectively nothing once team skill was controlled for. However, it should be noted that UEFA Champions League does not always play extra time when aggregate scores are tied. As Borg notes, 22 of 36 (61.1%) two-legged series in the MLS playoffs have been won by the team that played the second leg at home. However, because home teams tend to be better, much of that is likely due to skill, and not an additional home-field edge. Our models, which don’t give any <em>additional</em> home-boost for second-leg home teams, projected three second-leg home teams to win in the first round top win: Portland with 69 percent, Sporting with 66 percent, and New York with 59 percent. Even factoring in <span class="caps">RSL</span>’s 46 percent, the average percent of second-leg home teams expected to win in the first round was almost exactly—-you guessed it—-60 percent. With the data currently available, we have chosen not to include an additional home boost for second-leg home teams. With that out of the way…moving on! With two first-leg games down and two to go, we see two favorites in opposite positions. Portland is taking a one-goal lead back home, while Sporting returns to Kansas City facing a one-goal deficit. My method of projecting each team’s probability of winning its series will be derived from the assumption that teams favor a regulation win to a regulation draw on aggregate (and a draw to a loss) with the same weighted preferences as it would have favored those outcomes during the regular season. Thus, for example, I will treat the Portland-Seattle matchup as though Portland has an early lead in a regular-season-type game, and adjust our model’s probabilities according to that one-goal lead. The probabilities will be adjusted based on some <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/projects/game-states/">game states research</a> I have been working on. I have shown some nifty graphs below to help us out. The two graphs chart the approximate probability that the home team has of each of the three possible match outcomes based on two things: the goal differential and the minute mark. These graphs were created from game data up through June 8<span class="ord">th</span> of this season. The data was smoothed out using a lowess curve. <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/plus-one-goal-diff-win-expectancy-thru-6-8-13.jpeg" alt="Plus One Goal Diff Win Expectancy \(thru 6-8-13\)"> Portland essentially leads a home match by one goal in the first minute. A league-average team would win this type of match with an estimated 75-percent probability and tie with about 20-percent probability.<em> Another way to say the same thing is to say that the home team has 3-to-1 (3.00) odds of winning, and 1-to-4 (0.25) odds of tying. Through June 8<span class="ord">th</span> of this season, typical home teams won with 46-percent probability (0.85 odds) and tied with 29-percent probability (0.41 odds). Thus I can say that a typical team increases its odds of winning from 0.85 to about 3.00, a factor of 3.53, with an early one-goal lead. Additionally a typical team decreases its odds of tying by a factor of about 1.6 with that one-goal lead. .Portland’s odds of beating Seattle at home from an even game state are approximately 2.00 (66.7%), and its odds of tying are approximately 0.23 (18.8%). Using the appropriate odds ratios, one might conjecture that the Timbers’ odds of winning <em>this _game on aggregate are about 7.06 (87.6%), and it odds of tying this game are 0.14 (12.3%). A tie would essentially result in the coin-flipping grand finale known as penalty kicks, and thus <strong>Portland’s chances of a Conference Finals berth are 93.8 percent</strong> (.876 + 0.5 x .123). <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/minus-one-goal-diff-win-expectancy-thru-6-8-13.jpeg" alt="Minus One Goal Diff Win Expectancy \(thru 6-8-13\)"> Instead of going all nutzoid on Sporting <span class="caps">KC</span> as I did with Portland, one can trust that I followed the same methodology to arrive at my final conclusion. <strong>Sporting’s chances to advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals are about 47.8 percent</strong> by this use of odds ratios.** These probabilities will go into the simulation after all first legs are complete to update the <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/cup-chances-2013/">overall Cup probabilities.</a> </em></em>Due to a small sample size of plus-one goal differentials in the first 15 minutes of matches, the graph is trying to make us believe that a loss is more probable than a tie, when our logic should allow us to infer that—-with a one-goal lead—-a draw would be more probable than a loss. Thus I am using the more-stabilized figures around the 40-to-60-minute marks. The even goal differential graph—-not shown—-as well as the two graphs above suggest that probabilities don’t begin to change all that much until the 60<span class="ord">th</span> minute, an interesting topic for another day.<em> </em>**For those wanting to check my math, I assumed typical home teams in <span class="caps">SKC</span>’s position would win with 20-percent, probability and tie with 30-percent probability. SKC’s probabilities against New England in an even game state would be 64-percent and 26-percent for a win and tie, respectively.&nbsp;_</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/show-down-juan-agudelo-vs-diego-fagundez/">Show Down: Juan Agudelo vs. Diego Fagundez</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>During our podcast on Thursday night, a short side conversation was sparked between Drew and me. Who would you take in a situation where you are starting a new team: <strong>Juan Agudelo</strong> or <strong>Diego Fagundez</strong>. While the question and how it’s presented matters (i.e. how many years of control do you have, salary cap situation, blah, blah, blah) because it gives us context, let’s not go there. The discussion here is more about the general response. We’ve all, myself included, just generally assumed that the answer to any question between the two is: “Agudelo now, Fagundez later”. But what makes us think that Fagundez isn’t the better option right now? While doing our podcast I generally have between 9 and 15 browser tabs open with general bits of information. I’m sure my wife would argue that it’s more like 50. Whatever. It’s a lot. During that point in the podcast, I had Squawka up and quoted a total performance score of <strong>452</strong> for Fagundez, as opposed to Juan Agudelo and his shockingly low score of only <strong>57</strong>. So, the response then transforms itself from the answer that we thought we were sure of, to understanding what exactly Agudelo has done over the course of the season. Trust me, I get that numbers, especially in soccer, can’t tell an entire story. But they can help see us things that our brains don’t naturally keep track of. Agudelo, in my mind, is a special case of a lot of talent doing one specific thing and being credited for far more than perhaps initially thought. I know the other side of that argument stresses his physical traits and goal-scoring ability. Sure, those are two <span class="caps">HUGE</span> things when it comes to this game. Speed kills and Agudelo knows how to turn it on. Let’s take a look&nbsp;below. </p>

First, we can see one thing. And it’s quiet amazing. Together, the two players produced 20 goals on 60 shots. Take a second to think about that because that’s major. The Revolution took 37 shots and scored just <strong>one</strong> goal over their first <strong>five</strong> matches of the season. These guys get thrown into the line-up and procure 20 goals on just 60 shots. That’s special. Second, what is most obviously the difference between the two is the number of chances created. You’ll see in a second that Agudelo still made a fine amount of passes. The issue isn’t that he’s a ball hog, or that he just wants the chances for himself. The problem is those passes did not become chances on goal. You’d hope that a guy who gets plenty of attention from the defense has the ability to find open teammates that can create&nbsp;goals. </p>

Alright, onto the possession-based stuff. There are some interesting thoughts here. Such as Agudelo taking less dribbles, making shorter passes, and making more of them. It’s not something that I would have generally have thought of about him. I think of an individual who is looking to constantly run at defenders, but maybe that isn’t the whole picture. That said, he’s still losing the ball quiet a bit, and while Fagundez doesn’t make as many passes, he’s less error-prone and creates more pockets of space up the field with the ball at his&nbsp;feet. </p>

The biggest number that stands out to me on this page is the number of fouls committed per 90 minutes by Agudelo. There is no way he makes that many fouls and continues to only pull about 6 cards over the course of a full season. That’s impossible. Outside of that, you see that each of these players is rather close to one another. One is a bit more on top of clearances while the other interceptions. Really, that’s probably due to two random factors. 1) Agudelo is in the middle of the box more often for corner kicks, and 2) Fagundez works in the midfield where errant passes are more probable. It’s important to realize these players aren’t like for like. Trying to compare them as apples to apples isn’t going to work and makes this work less productive. I am willing to acknowledge that. Agudelo did have some opportunities in the midfield this season, however, he was primarily featured up top in the striker role. Likewise, Fagundez had some exciting moments playing center forward, but was primarily used out wide as a left midfielder. Because they don’t occupy the same space, certain statistical attributes that we associate with these players are going to be either more or less inflated. They have different responsibilities so they aren’t going to be the same player statistically. We don’t have a “Wins Above Replacement” calculator, as awesome as that would be. There is no key that unlocks all events and makes them equal, as if to say this player is better than that player, regardless of position or team. Maybe this post was a complete waste because we should be comparing these two teammates to the rest of the league, rather than to each other. What I do know is that Fagundez is less a player of the future and more of an <span class="caps">MLS</span> standout <em>now</em>, but when Agudelo leaves for Stoke, he is still going to be missed by the&nbsp;Revs.</p>
