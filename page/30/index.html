            <h2><a href="/articles/game-of-the-week-montreal-impact-chicago-fire/">Game of the Week: Montreal Impact at Chicago Fire</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>So why this game, you ask. Real Salt Lake is hosting Houston, and the Revs travel to play the Wiz, but I picked this game instead. Despite a negative goal differential, I like Chicago in this one. I smell upset. Our <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/"><span class="caps">MLS</span> tables</a> tell me that Chicago ranks 5<span class="ord">th</span> in the league in attempts ratio at 1.07, earning nearly 10% more shot attempts than its opponents on average. When we account for where those shots are coming from, our <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/shot-locations/">shot location data</a> suggests that Chicago’s goal differential should be pretty even: -0.04 expected goal differential (xGD) per game if I regress finishing rates 100%. Basically Chicago is an average team with a little bad own-goals luck. However, as I’ve been preaching all year, Montreal’s play is seemingly unsustainable, and it is playing on the road. Despite the most points per game in <span class="caps">MLS</span>, Montreal owns the third-worst attempts ratio in the league, and an expected goal differential of -0.20 goals per game. The Impact may very well be the second-best team on the pitch come Saturday. <strong>Chicago Fire Shots&nbsp;Data</strong></p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This week we welcome Chris Gluck as our first guest on the podcast. We talk possession, basic attacking principles and stats. Later on we mention #DempseyWatch. I talk about it from a Seattle perspective, discussing how the team could afford to make him the richest player in <span class="caps">MLS</span> history. We also talk a little Gold Cup final recap, and we wrap up the final segment with some Marrying, Boffing, and Killing of  Kris Boyd. Enjoy!

            <h2><a href="/articles/mls-home-field-advantage-and-success-rates/">MLS, Home Field Advantage And Success Rates</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This week on <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/07/28/asa-podcast-episode-15-the-one-where-we-talk-about-home-field-advantage/">the podcast</a> we talked a bit about home field advantage and the fact that it undeniably exists. But while it does exist, the question then becomes to what extent does it exist? What teams have taken advantage of it over the past few years? I went back as far as 2008 to collect some data. I’m not sure what this data all means, but I feel that it, at the very least, gives us a bit of commentary on those teams that had success and failure on their home pitches. I broke clubs into two groups: teams that scored more than 40 points and teams that scored less than 40 points. Then I compiled some key home stats for the two groups. A quick key for the stats used: <strong>%home won</strong>, is the percentage of possible games at home at the team won. Duh, right? <strong>%home points</strong> is the percentage of its home games in which the team nabbed <em>any</em> points (draw or win). <strong>%total of points</strong> is how many points from home games contributed to their total points accrued over the season. Then <strong><span class="caps">GD</span></strong> is just goal&nbsp;differential. </p>
