          <section class="content"><p>Today, I was asked simply, which team has the best pairing in <span class="caps">MLS</span>? It’s a good question, and oddly one that I’ve been asked a lot and. Despite the frequency of requests, it’s something that I have trouble answering. There are a lot of ways to measure performance for attacking personnel, but due to my time restraints I found the easiest way to do this was to go to Squawka and use their attack score. Below is a listing of teams and their two highest<em> attacking score combos. Since it’s a purely cumulative stat I pro-rated it to 90 minutes. As you probably wouldn’t be shocked to find out. <strong>Mike Magee</strong>,<strong> Landon Donovan</strong> and <em>*Federico Hinguian</em></em> round out the&nbsp;top-3. </p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/the-chicago-fire-and-goal-mouth-data/">The Chicago Fire and Goal Mouth Data</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This is merely a trial run. I say that because in the last two days I’ve limited the collection of data and then expanded it. It comes down to how it tickles my fancy. The data I have collected is limited for the time being to the Chicago Fire as just a means of comparing a club and its data to the league and trying to make sense of it. This hopefully will develop into the means of how I can some how attribute value to clubs and their keepers in the future. Below is a picture of the goal mouth, and the data has been collected from the website Sqwuaka.com. Coupled with a previously built image, you can see how Chicago compares to the rest of the league and how a majority of their goals have been scored this season. While numbers are always an important thing, remember that it’s more about ratios and the average occurrence than pure accumulation at this juncture. Not all teams have played the same amount of games and they haven’t had the same opportunities.  <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/shotsgoals-and-visuals1.png?w=890" alt="Shots+Goals and visuals"> <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/chicagofirehud.png?w=890" alt="ChicagoFireHUD"> In addition to the Goal Mouth visual, here is a field map diagram as it applies to the dimension of the field. This has already been provided in raw form in the data that Matty has collected and posted in the <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/shot-locations/team-by-team-shot-locations/">raw shot data</a> tab, but I wanted to have another visual to compare the above data. <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/chicagofire-shotfield.png?w=609" alt="ChicagoFire-ShotField"> The problem between the two is that there is no correlation between the fact that Chicago has allowed 4 goals in section 5 to the fact that they’ve also allowed 5 goals in SoT1 (for ease of the tally, I gave a numerical designation to each location on the goal mouth; starting at the top and working left to right). This is the next collaborative effort that I’m working on, gathering both the shot location of origin and placement on the goal, and from what specific individual at what time. This is a very time-intensive task and it’ll probably take me the rest of the week to complete it just for Chicago. However, I’m taking suggestions on how I could compile this data without hand jamming it into a flat file. An <span class="caps">SQL</span> dump of the current Opta database for the season would go a long ways to helping compile this data and would be nice. But I’m never above a bit of hard work.&nbsp;Thoughts?</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/mls-shots-on-target/">A Visual Look At Shots On Target</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This is part of my efforts to try to come up with a zone rating of sorts for goal keepers. The problem I’m running into at the moment is trying to find visual information for shots against. If I want to know how good Dan Kennedy was preventing goals against Columbus in week 1, I have to go to Columbus’ page on Squawka and narrow the shot data to that specific game. Basically, It just boils down to more time digging than I initially planned to devote. Quickly, here is a visual graphic that I made with the help of Excel. I know it’s not really pretty, but it delivers the data in the manner in which I needed it without getting caught up on eccentric details, details with which I often spend too much time meddling. <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/shotsgoals-and-visuals1.png?w=890" alt="Shots+Goals and visuals"> There isn’t a lot that this immediately tells you, of course. It’s more of a jumping off point to start comparing data once it is collected. That’s where the next effort is going to be headed. Who are the teams that are above league average and below league average? Are they bleeding low percentage goals, or are they being beat in an unusual zone? This information, while still miles from being complete, moves us in the right direction of knowing more about shots and goals than what we did previously. You’ll notice that I also included shots that are wide but still close to the post. I’m curious as to whether these shots numbers become inflated when playing teams with “better keepers”. Unfortunately we need to define what better is. Better than what, exactly? I’m not sure. Again, parameters haven’t been set, and data sets are still being gathered. This is a fun exercise and one that should, if nothing else, provide us with some excellent insight to teams and their seasons at this&nbsp;point.</p>
