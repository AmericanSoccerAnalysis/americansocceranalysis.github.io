<p><strong><span class="caps">CARLOS</span> ALVAREZ, MIDFIELDER - CHIVAS&nbsp;USA</strong></p>
<p>Alvarez does a lot of things really well. He’s rotated through a few different positions in the midfield for El Chelis this season and his accumulated stats kind of reflect&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Though interesting enough, for as up-and-down as the attack is, Alvarez hasn’t touched the ball as much as you think. At only 8.62% of his teams touches, he hasn’t been as involved in the total care of the&nbsp;ball.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>It’s late and I have no intention of staying up past midnight for another night only to be woken by my darling, love-of-my-life, three year old at 6 o’clock wanting to play angry birds. That all said, I have been messing around with collecting various Opta data on <strong>Deshorn Brown</strong> and <strong>DeAndre Yedlin</strong> for our upcoming Saturday podcast that is going to talk specifically about limited data analysis and cross positional rankings. Without giving away too much, it gave me an idea for a plus-minus system that could potentially work if balanced correctly. There are basic good things and bad things that occur on the pitch during the 90. Most of those things, those that involve the ball, are recorded by Opta. If you could somehow weight those events and come up with a system that associates a value to them, then you could potentially have a system that inherently grades players for how they perform on the ball across the board. What if you associated a key pass being worth a one-third what a goal is worth, being that a third of key passes lead to goals. Maybe a clearance or block is worth—-whatever that associated average is with preventing goals from being scored. Somewhere there could be a point scale that is attributed based upon how many times those events occur on average between goal scoring events and in game states. Matty has a nice little utility that he’ll be presenting soon in regards game states. It should, to undersell it a bit, be grand and possibly allow for these events to be contextualized and valued in a more meaningful capacity. I don’t know—maybe I’m drunk with coffee and in need of&nbsp;sleep.</p>

I have no idea why I’m up besides the fact that I don’t have to go to work in the morning. But with the upswing of free time, I’m just corralling the internet and generally reviewing information that I often don’t find time to cruise through. While sifting through data and spending my time nodding off to sleep at my key board, I came across <a href="http://www.optasports.com/en/playground-section.aspx">Opta’s playground</a> site where they are “opening up the database”. I’m not sure how new this is or if it is just something I missed. But I know it wasn’t available the last time I was around. It’s a basic request for <del>people</del> nerds like me (and possibly you…) to submit data requests. An understatement would be to call this development “cool”. A lot of data within Soccer is closed off and generally leaves a lot to be desired. Being a guy that used to write a lot about baseball, it would be awful—strickly speaking from my perspective—to write about a player if the lack of overall information that was provide is akin to that of modern day soccer data. It’s safeguarded and looked after as if it was top secret defense information. To be fair, I actually think that some of that information is kept more secure than defense information. But that’s not really the subject. Having the ability to submit an e-mail request for specific data is exciting. It’s a marked improved over the current status-que. Sure, you could complain about the fact that they only accept one application in all categories per e-mail address, but who cares it’s an improvement and here, that’s what we’re all&nbsp;about.</p>

It lead me back to thinking about some of the discussions that Matthias (apparently he has a real name), Keith (the missing guy in the podcasts), and I have had prior and outside of the podcasting realms. It’s not always about waiting to develop thoughts or theories until you have data, but making do with what you have at your current disposal and developing theories that later—with further advances—you can prove or&nbsp;disprove. </p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/the-possession-post/">A Post About Possession Stats</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>First of all, I had intended to have this up this past weekend and not on Thursday, my apologies. Secondly, I hope you all went out and looked at the <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/">stat table</a> that Matty put together. Some great accumulation of data and in a nice little format and summary that follows it. Great information and some stuff that isn’t readily available anywhere else. Consume this stat heads. This past weekend during our recording session we talked about possession. This has been talked and written about time, and time again by people much smarter than myself. I won’t waste a lot of my own words except to kind of bring things&nbsp;together. </p>
<p>get more (much more) after the&nbsp;jump</p>
<p>Graham MacAree, wrote a <a href="http://www.weaintgotnohistory.com/2012/4/22/2966747/possession-analysis-football-statistics">brilliant piece about Opta stats</a> and how they specifically calculate possession as a whole. To save you a bit of time, the summation of the finding is that Opta, at the time, calculates possession as pass volume. Meaning if you take the entire amount of pass attempts over the 90’ minutes and divide that against each of the sides pass attempts you would get the reported amount of “possession”. <a href="http://prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com/2012/04/23/opta-possession-stat-not-based-on-time-on-number-of-passes/">Richard Farely</a> does a great summation on why that’s&nbsp;bad. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does this mean? Let’s take a totally fake scenario. Barcelona plays three quick passes before trying a through ball that rolls to Petr Cech. It all takes four seconds, while Petr Cech keeps the ball at his feet for eight seconds before picking it up, holding it for five seconds, then putting it out for a throw in, which takes eight more seconds to put back into play. Despite Barcelona having possession for only four of those 25 fake seconds, they’d have 80 percent of Opta’s possession (three good passes plus one bad, while Chelsea had only Cech’s unsuccessful pass). A logical expectation of a zero-sum possession figure would have that as either 16 percent or (if you credit the time out of play as Barça’s, since they’d have the ensuing throw) 48 percent Barcelona’s. Or, if you do a three-stage model (that’s sometimes reported in Serie A matches), you’d have 16 percent Barcelona, 52 percent Chelsea, and 32 percent&nbsp;limbo/irrelevant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I say “at the time” because I attempted to do that tonight and my math was a bit off. So it’s possible they also incorporate another statistic or something a long those lines. It’s highly unlikely that they have gone towards a game clock as they still report in percentages. Now it’s fair to argue that the possession stat is meaningless, as <strong>[Rui Xu</strong>](<a href="https://twitter.com/rui_xu">https://twitter.com/rui_xu</a>) (follow him on twitter, seriously, do it now) of Sporting Kansas City Performance and Statistical Analytics department thinks the&nbsp;following: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, I think they’re useless because they don’t contain any context. There is little-to-no correlation with points (if anything, there’s a slightly negative correlation in the <span class="caps">MLS</span>), and it doesn’t really tell you anything on a performance analysis level. Once you start adding context is when you’ll be able to draw some narratives. What is the possession percentage of the road team after they go up 1-0?  What was it before?  What is the possession percent of the home team when up 2-0 after the 80<span class="ord">th</span> minute?  You still have to be very, very cautious though.  -<strong>[ Numerology: How valuable is possession anyway?</strong>](<a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/numerology/news/article/2012/06/21/numerology-figuring-out-where-theres-value-field">http://www.mlssoccer.com/numerology/news/article/2012/06/21/numerology-figuring-out-where-theres-value-field</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, it’s countered very well by the Revolutions Timothy&nbsp;Crawford. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s hard to say exactly what possession necessarily does at this point. Barcelona out-possesses everyone, but they certainly dropped some points and big matches. There have been studies that have shown teams that win often lose the possession battle, but as my statistics classes taught me, correlation does not necessarily imply causation. No one is saying the way to win more matches is to never have the ball. It’s trying to find what part of possession is important, and then applying that to&nbsp;tactics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look, there is a mass amount of information that has basically flooded our ability to start analyzing the American version of “the beautiful game,” and guess what, we’re going to turn it into 1’s and 0’s because we’re all a bunch of Yankee bastards.  But as we do that there are going to be plenty of things that we don’t know. I’m not sold that Possession is useless, but I can’t think of exactly what is needed to make it “good” or what “good” it could produce at distant point in the future. Matthias at a certain point on our podcast mentioned specific time spent in attack or in the opposing third, versus the ball residing in your own defensive third.These things of course matter as they will eventually create opportunities for you or your opponent. That leads into the thought that not every chance on goal is documented by a shot. There are plenty of these that stopped just short by defenders or goal keepers making last ditch efforts. That being said if you sit inside and lob in crosses hoping to get luck, Charles Reep style, against a team such as San Jose or Los Angeles that is remarkably well versed in protecting such an attack, what does it really matter how much time you had in the attack. You wasted it. That being said, <a href="http://www.zonalmarking.net/2012/05/04/the-relationship-between-possession-and-shots/">Zonal Marking has done some correlative work</a> between the relation of shots and&nbsp;possessions. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you might expect, there’s a fairly obvious correlation – the more possession you have, the more shots on goal you’re likely to attempt, which is hardly a revelation. The graph is interesting, however, for two reasons. First, because there are clear differences between the five separate leagues. Second, because there’s a handful of sides that don’t fit the pattern, and a lot of variation amongst the sides who see a lot possession. The sides who are significantly ‘higher’ on the graph compared to the line of best fit are particularly efficient with possession – they have more shots than you’d expect for the amount of the ball they enjoy. Those who are significantly ‘lower’ are less efficient – they see a lot of the ball but record relatively few shots on goal. Of course, being more or less efficient is not necessarily ‘better’ – because the sole purpose of possession is not to score a goal. Possession can be used as a defensive tactic to play out time when a side is ahead, and can be used to tire the opposition, before attacking more directly later on. The intention here is not to ‘rank’ sides, but to show their different&nbsp;styles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the biggest thing is how he ended those paragraphs “but to show their different styles”. I think the biggest thing that possession shows me, at least for the time being, is what type of team you are. Are you comfortable with the ball or without it? Do you run up-and-down the pitch all day, winning and then losing possession; pressing for that additional chance at goal? Maybe current possession stats can’t tell us all of that information. But looking at break downs and heat maps of possession and the pitch, where players possessed the ball the most, can supply and relate to us an (albeit short) narrative. And ultimately it’s all about context and applying it to the data that we use. Understanding why we chose the data we did and then being able to articulate it back to others, who can point out deficiencies as well as some of it’s&nbsp;strengths.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>Hello, there, you fine traveller… if you are of a west coast bias you’ll love today’s show. First I have to say I’m really sadden by the fact that neither myself nor Matty worked in a “Third” joke with as much as we like to talk about cutting the field into thirds with this being our third podcast. <em>sigh</em> it didn’t happen, maybe we’ll save the jokes for episode 33. Anyways… we have the following for you. - We chronicle the life and times of your’s truly, me, Harrison Crow, and little background as to why I created the site - We talk a bit about possession stats, why they’re important, why they are not and how they are sometimes misleading. I referenced a <a href="http://www.optasportspro.com/en/about/optapro-blog/posts/2012/possession%28s%29.aspx">blog post by Opta</a> during this conversation… please take a look it has a lot of really good information. I’m trying to come up with a bunch of material for a post later on today. I hope you all check it out. - We do mention Montreal and their Italian influenced defense/counter-attack system and how it’s helped them to a 2<span class="ord">nd</span> place start in the Eastern Conference - Next, we chronicle the poor start to the Sounders and why their possession stats are so high, yet have produced no goals. We also mention a bit about Sporting Kansas City and the <span class="caps">LA</span> Galaxy, as well as the Portland Timbers and their dominance in possession. - We use the segue of the Portland Timbers to talk a little bit about Will Johnson…underrated pick-up, amazing goals, and his ability to troll on Alan Gordon. Yep, he’s gone for 3 games. Gordon, not Johnson… <img src="http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BH3q2uOCcAAYBNy.png" alt=""> And for those of you who didn’t catch his brilliant goal, at home, which in turn gave the Timbers 3-points, check it out below: [youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHMV-zPqccc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHMV-zPqccc</a>] - Lastly we talked about our “game-of-the-week” which we selected Sporting Kansas City and Los Angeles Galaxy. While separated by 7 points in the table—and more specifically 2 games in hand by <span class="caps">LA</span>—-Tempo-Free Soccer has them ranked 1 and 2. We make our picks for who we like, why, and a few little facts to back it up. This podcast is a bit longer than usual at 45 mins, I hope you enjoy!
