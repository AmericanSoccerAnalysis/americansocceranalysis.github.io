          <section class="content"><p>Family in town, waiting out this baby and being home doing nothing sure has made me lazy. So lazy that I really didn’t get around to editing this and putting it together until last night. My apologies for the late posting. This week we discuss the <span class="caps">USMNT</span> and their romp in eastern Europe, a bit about Montreal and Omar Gonzalez. Then we transition to some discussion about whether goal keepers can influence shots on target. It’s all some interesting stuff with a lot of giggling by me because I coined a new nickname for Drew.

            <h2><a href="/articles/signal-and-noise-in-mls/">Signal and Noise in MLS</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Some Nate Silver guy wrote a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4zhI9uLs4U">whole book</a> about “signal” and “noise” in data, so it must be important, right? Sports produce a lot of statistics, and it turns out that some of those statistics are pretty meaningless—-that is, pretty noisy. A pitcher’s <span class="caps">ERA</span> is sitting below 3.00 after eight starts, but he has more walks than strikeouts. Baseball sabermetricians will tell you that the low ERA is mostly noise, but that the high walk rate is a signal for impending doom. An MLS team leads the league in points per match, but it allows more shots than it earns for itself (note: this team is called “Montreal Impact”). Soccer nerds like me will tell you that its position in the standings is mostly noise, and that its low shots ratio is a signal for impending doom—-or something worse than first place, anyway. The reasoning behind both examples above is basically the same. Pitchers’ ERAs, like soccer teams’ points earned, are highly variable and unpredictable, while strikeout-to-walk ratios and shots ratios are more consistent. It’s better to put your money on something consistent and easy to predict, rather than something variable and hard to predict. Duh, right? So here’s why we like shots data ‘round these parts. Below I have provided two charts of MLS data, one from 2012 and one from 2013. I split each season into two parts and then measured the linear predictive power of each stat on itself. Did teams that scored lots of goals early in the season also score lots of goals later in the season? That’s the kind of question answered&nbsp;here. </p>

<p>Shots off Goal

43.7%
Goals
1.5%
61.6%
As an example of what this means, let’s consider the attempts stat. Remember that an attempt is any effort in the direction of the goal, so basically an attempt is any shot—-on target, off target, or blocked. In each of the past two seasons, <span class="caps">MLS</span> teams’ attempts totals in the first half of the season were able to help predict their attempts totals in the second half, explaining 26.1% and 34.5% of the variability in second-half attempts, respectively. Those might not seem like high percentages of explanation, but the MLS season is short, and statistically significant predictors are hard to find. In baseball, such “self-predictors” have been referred to as “stabilization.” Stabilization is important because, as mentioned above, stabilization means that a stat is consistent, and that a team is likely to replicate its results in the future. This MLS season, points earned during the first 10 matches were essentially worthless at predicting points earned in the second 10 games. Even over the 34 games each team played in 2012, the stabilization for points earned was not as strong as that of attempts or goals scored.* The next step is figuring out what predicts future points earned, since it does a pretty lame job of predicting itself. But I’ll leave that for another post after I have gathered data going back a few more seasons. The number one takeaway here is that some stats can only tell us what happened, but not what will happen. There is another group of stats that are doubly important because they also stabilize—-predicting themselves using smaller sample sizes. Those stabilizing stats (like shot attempts) are the signal amid the sea of noise known most places as “football.” <em>Seattle has only played 21 games, so I cannot do 11-and-11 splits, yet.  Also, as for why shots off goal and blocked shots have essentially switched places, I would wager that’s more due to how they are (somewhat) subjectively categorized, but who&nbsp;knows. </em></p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/game-of-the-week-montreal-impact-chicago-fire/">Game of the Week: Montreal Impact at Chicago Fire</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>So why this game, you ask. Real Salt Lake is hosting Houston, and the Revs travel to play the Wiz, but I picked this game instead. Despite a negative goal differential, I like Chicago in this one. I smell upset. Our <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/"><span class="caps">MLS</span> tables</a> tell me that Chicago ranks 5<span class="ord">th</span> in the league in attempts ratio at 1.07, earning nearly 10% more shot attempts than its opponents on average. When we account for where those shots are coming from, our <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/shot-locations/">shot location data</a> suggests that Chicago’s goal differential should be pretty even: -0.04 expected goal differential (xGD) per game if I regress finishing rates 100%. Basically Chicago is an average team with a little bad own-goals luck. However, as I’ve been preaching all year, Montreal’s play is seemingly unsustainable, and it is playing on the road. Despite the most points per game in <span class="caps">MLS</span>, Montreal owns the third-worst attempts ratio in the league, and an expected goal differential of -0.20 goals per game. The Impact may very well be the second-best team on the pitch come Saturday. <strong>Chicago Fire Shots&nbsp;Data</strong></p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This week on <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/07/28/asa-podcast-episode-15-the-one-where-we-talk-about-home-field-advantage/">the podcast</a> we talked a bit about home field advantage and the fact that it undeniably exists. But while it does exist, the question then becomes to what extent does it exist? What teams have taken advantage of it over the past few years? I went back as far as 2008 to collect some data. I’m not sure what this data all means, but I feel that it, at the very least, gives us a bit of commentary on those teams that had success and failure on their home pitches. I broke clubs into two groups: teams that scored more than 40 points and teams that scored less than 40 points. Then I compiled some key home stats for the two groups. A quick key for the stats used: <strong>%home won</strong>, is the percentage of possible games at home at the team won. Duh, right? <strong>%home points</strong> is the percentage of its home games in which the team nabbed <em>any</em> points (draw or win). <strong>%total of points</strong> is how many points from home games contributed to their total points accrued over the season. Then <strong><span class="caps">GD</span></strong> is just goal&nbsp;differential. </p>
