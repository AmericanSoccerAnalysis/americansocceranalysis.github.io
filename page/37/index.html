          <section class="content"><p>While digging through Wikipedia and various articles yesterday, I noticed the following. In 2010, after the expansion draft, <span class="caps">DC</span> United traded midfielder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helbert_Frederico_Carreiro_da_Silva">Fred Carreiro</a>, allocation money and the #8 pick in the 2010 super draft to Philadelphia in return for goalkeeper, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Perkins">Troy Perkins</a>. That #8 draft pick was used to draft <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_McInerney">Jack McInerney</a>. Maybe you’ve heard of him. Keep that in mind when people mention the need for <span class="caps">DC</span> to find a goal&nbsp;scorer.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/dc-united-alain-rochart/">DC United Score Alain Rochart On The Cheap</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Today, the Vancouver Whitecaps traded defender <strong>Alain Rochart</strong>, their starting left back, to <span class="caps">DC</span> United for <a href="http://metronews.ca/news/vancouver/697810/whitecaps-trade-alain-rochat-to-d-c-united/">a second-round selection in the 2015 <span class="caps">MLS</span> SuperDraft as well as an conditional pick in 2016</a>. Vancouver gets a rough lottery ticket, a little bit of freed up cash and the United get a veteran defensive back.  It’s not specified if Vancouver will still be on the hook for Rochart’s salary, but considering the lack of return, for the basis of this work I’m going to assume that to be the case. The trade on the peripherals seems rather odd and strikes a few questions in my mind as to why this move was even made and what <span class="caps">EXACTLY</span> did each team acquire. Looking at the Swede, Alain Rochat, DC United obviously get a guy who is average positionally in the league. He’s not brilliant by any stretch of the imagination, but he’s not bad at what he does. He’s going to give you minutes; he’s given the Whitecaps back-to-back seasons of nearly 2,500 minutes. While being able to provide minutes is great, the larger issue is the quality of those minutes. How does he compare to the rest of the league?  According to the site Whoscored.com they have him listed as the 9<span class="ord">th</span> best starting left back in MLS and is the 8<span class="ord">th</span> highest paid. So over all the price tag pretty much suits what  he costs, though the <em>average</em> cost of an outside back is roughly&nbsp;$100k. </p>

Interestingly enough, Rochart matches up pretty well with Portland Timbers left back Michael Harrington, who costs just a nudge more and is rated very similarly. Both possess the ball well and deliver smart short passes out of the back while neither are very strong at tackling. This comparison is interesting simply because the Timbers acquired Harrington from Sporting Kansas City this past off-season. While the details of the deal aren’t disclosed to the public, we know that it centered around allocation money and  a guess in the $75K range isn’t crazy. So we can say the going rate for which <span class="caps">DC</span> United paid for is roughly $75K in “<em>specialized</em> “cap space. That’s on top of the money that is saved from moving the individual. <span class="caps">DC</span> United paid a draft pick, potentially two, depending on the circumstances—of which we have no idea. So let’s just work with the understanding that they are only giving up a second round pick in two years. This is a little tricky because of the fact that we don’t necessarily know what overall pick DC United will be giving up. While this matters only for the sake of history and being able to create context based upon past experiences, it only minimally limits our understanding of the value of this pick. In the 2013 Superdraft, a second-round pick’s average contract was worth roughly 35K, and that’s specifically for a young-ish sort of player that qualifies for the draft. While that potentially could be of some value, you can see players such as <strong>Chris Klute</strong>, <strong>Chris Tierney</strong> and<strong> Seth Sinovic</strong> as great examples, as it could lend itself to assisting to provide some roster flexibility. It’s not nearly as lucrative as any type of allocation&nbsp;money.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/game-of-the-week-review-montreal-impact-visit-sporting-kansas-city/">Game Of The Week Review: Montreal Impact Visit Sporting Kansas City</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I know I shouldn’t be surprised by the Impact stealing a match on the road, especially considering Sporting’s lack of strength at home as of their recent string of outcomes. Though, with all the statistical pointers, it’s quiet uncanny that they came up with even a point, let alone all three. <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/skc-imp.png" alt="SKC-IMP"> It’s hard to look at the tackles, interceptions and clearances and not think that it’s a by product of the Impact largely being on their heels for the majority of the match. That in large part is due to the style which the Montreal Impact implements. The team as a whole has functioned with 48% possession through 12 matches and even less possession (44%) in away games. It’s not a bad thing, but it naturally produces more defensive events. Much of our discussion during the podcasts has dealt with shots and their predictive nature. Montreal has been at the forefront of the discussion, with amazing results despite being outshot on both total attempts at goal (12 to 15 per game) and actual shots on target (4.9 to 5.2) Montreal Impact is currently now sporting 26 points with a goal differential of +7. Not to mention they are boasting the highest conversion rate in the league of 15.3%. Better than the next highest (<span class="caps">FC</span> Dallas, 13.9%) by nearly a whole point and a half. Matthias, Drew and I have discussed whether or not Montreal can continue to maintain such a high finishing rate. It’s a legitimate question considering the construct of the situation but, as pointed out by <a href="https://twitter.com/analyseFooty/status/341571522672070657">Ravi Ramineni</a> in a discussion this morning on twitter, ‏the problem with making such assertions is that we’re looking purely at the shot totals rather than looking at the qualitative state of the shot. However, while it’s interesting enough to question whether or not the Impact are going to stick around and continue to score goals at their current rate, I’m going to leave that for another day. It’s even more interesting that Kansas City came up with twice the amount of attempts on goal and the only scored once. That one goal was on a foul that was made right on the line of the 18 yard box. Had the linesman not been on his game, that call could have easily been a free kick. The question that I really have is more of why was Sporting unable to build upon their chances. Looking at the amount of clearances that the Impact had  I kind of wondered if the fact was that they just couldn’t maintain the needed pressure upon Troy Perkins&nbsp;goal. </p>

<img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/skctimeline.png?w=890" alt="SKCTimeline"> Looking at this you can see three real bunches. First at the 69<span class="ord">th</span>-71<span class="ord">st</span> minute, Again with the 76<span class="ord">th</span> and 78<span class="ord">th</span> minute and then in the final moments game a solid run of 90 to 94, ending with Kei Kamra’s shot that just drifted wide. Ultimately, I’m more inclined to believe that Sporting did just as much to not earn a result as the Impact did to really earn one. But while most people would be willing to chalk this game up to luck, I just think it’s the largest example of what the Impact do well, and that’s disrupting opposing teams while allowing the Impact to sit in their own defensive third. I’m still not inclined, as I’m sure Matty isn’t either, to give the Impact the full rights of being a team that is “for real”. But they certainly continue to prove their case week in and week&nbsp;out.</p>
