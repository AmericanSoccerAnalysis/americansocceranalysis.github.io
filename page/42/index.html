            <h2><a href="/articles/game-of-the-week-recap-new-england-revolution-vs-philadaelphia-union/">Game Of The Week Recap: New England Revolution vs. Philadaelphia Union</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>It’s Monday morning! Hope you’ve had your coffee, been to your morning meetings and are ready to catch up on the <span class="caps">MLS</span> weekend. We’re not probably at the point to where we’re going to review games or teams on a consistent basis. That’s not really our thing… at least, not yet. But Saturday on the most recent podcast, Matty and I talked about our game of the week, featuring the New England Revolution at home versus a high powered Philadelphia attack. The Union boys are a club that, in general, doesn’t keep possession long, nor win it back. But they rely specifically on creating as many chances as possible and finishing the ones they are supposed too. It’s partially why they are an improved club this year and one that has a legit chance to get into the playoffs and do some damage in the East. They were coming up against a New England team that averaged less ball possession, won the ball back less and took a whole lot less shots—-and the Revolution was even allowing its opponents twice as many opportunities as it earned for itself. What it came down to was that Philly was a borderline good team that sat near mid-table, and New England was arguably one of the worst-seeded among those in the bottom. The surprising thing, and partly what made us choose this game as our game of the week, was simply how split the analysts were at MLSsoccer.com. Two were for a draw, two for a Union win, and two had the Rev’s with a win. All the way around it was kind of an interesting match-up of a slumping team against a club that seemed to be on it’s way up. If you didn’t hear the podcast, I had the Union 2-1, and Matty went even further with a 2-0 Union beating on the road in Foxborough. Both of us look a little silly this morning with the Revolution pulling out the win. So, how exactly did this band of struggling MLS misfits steal 3-points? Simple, they finally took and finished shots. The first capture below is the Revs and their chances created in the attacking third. This is shots, key passes and corner kicks and successful free-kicks leading to&nbsp;attempts. </p>

<p>The next shot is clearances, interceptions, recoveries, tackles, blocks, saves and punches made by the the keeper/back defensive four of the Union inside their own box… it’s kind of a&nbsp;mess.</p>
<p><img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/uniond-201304271.jpeg?w=300" alt="UnionD-20130427"></p>
<p>The bottom line is that for the first time, possibly all season, the Revolution were dangerous on the attack and they not only put shots on target, they legitimately tested the opposing defense. Then, once they had a lead, they allowed their strong defense to carry them home for the full 3&nbsp;points.</p>
<p>Almost as convicting, the Union were only able to create 6 real attempts on goal in the second half and only 4 after the Rev’s finally broke the stalemate. While they weren’t bad on the attacking end, it just simply didn’t match what the home team was accomplishing, and it left Philly out points at the end of the&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>I think this sort of game underlines the amount of parity that is in this league right now and also the fact that you have to consider a team’s incredibly poor finishing rate as <strong>not</strong> being an indication of true talent—-at least, not this early in the season. New England basically out-Union’d the Union, by beating them while playing their own style of play on the pitch. Overwhelming them with shots and finishing opportunities. Both teams will face exceptionally tough tasks by playing Northwest clubs (Portland and Seattle, respectively) next week, and it should be interesting to see what comes of&nbsp;it.</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>If you have listened to our podcasts or read through our stuff, you will have heard us talk about shot ratios a lot. That’s how many shots a team gets divided by how many shots its allows its opponents. A shot ratio of 1.5, for example, means that a team gets one-and-a-half times as many shots as its opponents. When soccer teams create extra opportunities for themselves, it generally leads to more goals and more points in the standings. And then there’s Montreal. The Montreal Impact has been something of a Cinderella story this season, at least statistically. Leading up to its matchup with the Chicago Fire on Saturday, the Impact had recorded the <strong><em>second-worst</em></strong> shot attempt ratio in the entire league. Montreal had earned just 61 shot attempts with 28 on target to its opponents’ 95 shot attempts with 32 on target.  Yet somehow, the Impact had maintained a positive goal differential (+2) and the second-most points per match right behind <span class="caps">FC</span> Dallas. Against Chicago, Montreal not only won on the scoreboard two-nil, it also won the shooting and possession battles. But that is a rare feat this year for the Impact, and it’s worth posing the question: Has Montreal been lucky this season, or does it do things that shot ratios and possession just can’t explain? Using just <strong><em>shots on goal</em></strong> for now, I regressed goal scoring ratios against shot ratios to see how teams “should do,” as if shots on goal were the only thing that matter. Even this early in the season, the regression was not all that bad (R2 = 0.4). It also said that Montreal’s 0.94 <em>shot</em> ratio should lead to about the same <em>goal</em> ratio.<em> Well that makes sense. If you generate roughly the same number of shots on target as your opponents, you should score about the same number of goals. The Impact, however, have scored nine goals to its opponents’ five—a 1.8 ratio, or +4 differential, if you prefer. An obvious thing to consider is finishing rate. Despite being outshot, the Impact players finish their attempts with goals <em>*<em>more than twice as efficiently </em></em></em>as opponents do. That ratio is the best in the league. My first instinct is that the Impact has been somewhat lucky, and that opponents will start to finish with more frequency. But there are two possible explanations I want to explore first before waving the cliché luck flag: the quality of opportunities for Montreal and the quality of opportunities for its opponents. Harrison talked a little bit about Montreal’s counter-attacking style during a recent podcast, and there’s a possibility that the Impact’s style allows low-quality opportunities to its opponents, leading to higher-percentage opportunities for itself on the counter attack. (Before we investigate, it should be noted that Montreal’s schedule has featured teams that average out to be, well, league-average when it comes to finishing.) Let’s take Saturday’s match against the Fire as an example of the tools I’m using. Check out the Opta chalkboard for yourself <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2013-04-27-MTL-v-CHI/chalkboard">here</a>, and you can see from where teams are shooting and scoring by clicking the appropriate boxes for team and statistic of interest. During this particular game, I have Montreal down for 16 scoring attempts, nine from outside the box, six inside, and one from right on the edge. Both its goals were scored from inside the box (though you could argue one was one the edge). Chicago, on the other hand, earned 11 attempts, ripping seven of those from outside the box, just two from inside, and two from the edge of the box. Chicago did not score. I did this for each of Montreal’s seven games this season. Obviously things like angle matter, too, but I’m not going to pull out my protractor for this one. Here’s the breakdown for Montreal and its opponents on the&nbsp;season: </p>
<p><em>Attempts</em>
<em>Goals</em>
<em>Finishing</em></p>
<p><strong>Stat</strong>
<strong>Montreal</strong>
<strong>Opponents</strong>
<strong>Montreal</strong>
<strong>Opponents</strong>
<strong>Montreal</strong>
<strong>Opponents</strong></p>

<p>1.8%</p>

<p>6</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>0</p>
<p>0</p>
<p>0.0%</p>

<p><strong>Total</strong></p>
<p><strong>77</strong></p>
<p><strong>106</strong></p>
<p><strong>9</strong></p>
<p><strong>5</strong></p>
<p><strong>11.7%</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.7%</strong></p>
<p>  Montreal earns more shots inside the box than outside, and that might very well be a product of its system and players, rather than just dumb luck. While the Impact is being outshot in total, perhaps that stat is skewed slightly by shot selection. Montreal’s system seems to create a greater proportion of opportunities in the box. I would still expect some regression from Montreal this season back toward the middle of the standings—as its shot ratios are not favorable even after adjusting for quality—but perhaps not as far as a simple shot model would&nbsp;suggest.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>It’s Saturday and time to drop yet another American Soccer Analysis Podcast on you all. As we’ve been previewing this past week, we’re going to talk a bit about some of the up and coming <span class="caps">MLS</span> rookies that have played a big role on their teams to this point in the season. We’ll add in our thoughts on using a Plus/Minus statistic for measuring individual performance, as well as our selection for game of the week. Hope you enjoy.
