      <description>&lt;p&gt;The optimist looks at Real Salt Lake’s 2013 season and praises the club for making the MLS Cup Finals. The pessimist complains that they lost the MLS Cup Finals in penalty kicks despite holding a lead with 15 minutes remaining, facing a goalkeeper who seemed like his joints had frozen solid. The optimist praises the club’s performance in the U.S. Open Cup, lauding their run to the finals. The pessimist complains that they lost in the finals against DC United, a dreadful team. The optimist praises the team for finishing with a 16-10-8 record and a +16 goal differential in the regular season. The pessimist complains that they failed to win the Supporters Shield (again!) by 3 points. For Real Salt Lake in 2013, perception was everything.  &lt;strong&gt;2013 Finish: 16-10-8, 56 points; 57 GF, 41 GA. Second place in Western Conference. Lost in MLS Cup Finals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt; Know When to Hold ‘Em&lt;/strong&gt; In early 2013, Real Salt Lake owner Dell Loy Hanson made the decision not to extend Jason Kreis’s contract, gambling that Kreis’s stock would come down and he would be able to nab the coach at a bargain price. After all, the club had just lost Will Johnson, Jamison Olave, Fabian Espindola, and Jonny Steele in an offseason filled with cost-cutting moves. 2013 seemed likely to be a rebuilding year. Twelve months and two cup finals later, Jason Kreis is preparing for the 2015 debut of New York City FC, leaving Jeff Cassar, promoted from assistant coach, to lead Real Salt Lake. Cassar, with the team since 2007, is a safe choice, but even with all 11 starters returning, he may find it difficult to replicate the kind of success that RSL achieved under Jason Kreis. &lt;strong&gt;In Good Hands&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/2014-rsl-roster-2014-02-241.png&quot; alt=&quot;2014 RSL Roster - 2014-02-24&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;**Nick Rimando returns to man the RSL nets for the 8th consecutive season. There’s nothing much that can be said about Rimando that you probably don’t already know. A 14-year veteran of the league, Rimando has ascended to third in command of the United States net. Remarkably, Rimando has a 10-0-0 record with the U.S. team, and is already tied for 5th all-time on the goalkeeper victory list with Brad Guzan. Rimando’s national team opportunities have come as a result of stellar club play. Last season, he finished 2nd to Donovan Ricketts in Goalkeeper of the Year award voting, and was probably unlucky to do so. Rimando really is the total package: His &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYpEGAKFud0&quot;&gt;reflexes and shot-stopping ability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; are legendary, and while it may not surprise you that Rimando finished 4th in pass completion percentage, the diminutive Rimando is also an excellent commander of his penalty area. In 2014, Rimando finished 4th in MLS in catches per 90 with 2.63. This paragraph is far too long for one that could have been summed up simply with “Real Salt Lake is in good hands with Nick Rimando.” &lt;/strong&gt;Continuity in the Back&lt;strong&gt; With Chris Wingert, Nat Borchers, Chris Schuler, and Tony Beltran patrolling in front of him, Nick Rimando, too, will be in good hands. In the playoffs, Borchers and Schuler showed the potential to become one of the best pairings in the league. Though that is contingent on whether Schuler can remain healthy. In both the 2012 and 2013 seasons, Schuler was sidelined for multiple months with a foot injury. It was evident just how much Salt Lake missed Schuler last season when he was injured: with Schuler on the field last season, RSL conceded only 0.94 goals per 90, without him, they conceded 1.45 goals per 90. Yes, the sample size is small, and no, these numbers do not take into account opponent and location of the game. Still, Schuler’s contributions to defense were evident when 20-year old Carlos Salcedo was forced to step in. Nat Borchers provides much more certainty. In his 9-year Major League Soccer career (he spent two years with Odd Grenland in Norway), Borchers has averaged more than 28 starts per season. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/rslinfo.png?w=182&quot; alt=&quot;RSLinfo&quot;&gt;The Best Defense…** However, for all they do defensively, it may be their contributions to the attack that makes the RSL backline so valuable. Nat Borchers is one of the calmest defensive distributers in the league. Last season he had the 3rd best pass completion rate in the league, behind only Osvaldo Alonso and George John. This may be because Real Salt Lake puts a premium on possession and building the attack from the back, which sees Beckerman and the rest of the midfielders providing outlet options constantly. The team led MLS last season in possession percentage, pass success percentage, and percentage of passes that were under 25 yards. After all, Kwame Watson-Siriboe finished with a 93% passing rate (in but a mere handful of games), and Carlos Salcedo and Schuler both finished above 80%.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Season Preview: Houston Dynamo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the club arrived in Houston &lt;strong&gt;Dominic Kinnear&lt;/strong&gt; has built himself an empire, but not one built off big names or flashy play. Playing on the smallest pitch in MLS, the club is built on sound fundamentals. Defense might not necessarily win games but it can secure points on the road. Combine that with the fortress that has been the Orange’s BBVA Compass stadium—where they went an MLS record 36 home games without a loss stretching multiple seasons—and Houston can get points anywhere consistently. They’ve made the playoffs 7 out of their 8 years since arriving in Space City, so the goal of 2014 isn’t just to make the playoffs. It’s about getting back to the MLS Cup and taking it back for the first time since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-&quot;&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2014-preview&quot;&gt;2014 Preview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/houinfo.png?w=182&quot; alt=&quot;HOUINFO&quot;&gt; The core of Houston has always been built around their defense, but this season may prove to be a bit of a departure from that theme. The club chose to decline &lt;strong&gt;Bobby Boswell&lt;/strong&gt;‘s contract and instead went with a rotating duo of veterans at centerback to be paired with Jamaican stalwart&lt;strong&gt; Jermaine Taylor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; Eric Brunner&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;David Horst&lt;/strong&gt;, both 28, aren’t the sexiest names in regards to defense, but then again defense is generally the least sexy place on the pitch. When you consider the fact that this is normally a strength, falling backwards now to Brunner and Horst is probably a less than appealing subject for those in Houston. &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/hou-roster.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hou-Roster&quot;&gt;That said, I established a rule two years ago. I have a series of rules that I generally come up with in dealing with life in general. These rules aren’t so much rules as just helpful guidlines that generally keep me from more problems. High on that list is to never, ever bet against Dominic Kinnear. (Right after never betting at all because it’s a misdemeanor in Washington). The guy just knows A) how to get to the playoffs and B) how to put together a roster. Probably in the opposite order, though. The cheaper tandem along the backline helps them conserve cash while still providing depth and coverage at an important position. Considering the club failed to make the CCL this year, they were faced with a smaller budget to keep the players they had and still find reasonable depth for the season. There is, of course, the question about how big of a defensive drop off they are going to experience from Boswell to someone like Brunner. But considering our numbers have Tally Hall as one of the top goal keepers in the league, and they don’t even pay him anywhere near it, the Dynamo should remain a top defensive team. While everyone likes to rant and rave about &lt;strong&gt;Brad Davis&lt;/strong&gt; and his left foot, as the career leader in both assists and goals for the club, it’s easy to pass over &lt;strong&gt;Oscar Boniek Garcia&lt;/strong&gt; the other major attacking threat from the midfield. OBG led the club in key passes with 76 and added 18 total shots, as well. Another one of those is lesser heralded moves was Alexander Lopez being added from Honduras. Lopez, a member of the U-23 national team and possibly an option for the Honduras World cup team, was brought into the club last summer. Though Lopez was mostly invisible to the scoring operations taking place in Houston last season, Garcia has taken him under his wing this off-season and is helping to groom his fellow countryman. Adding to the fire that is burning bright with the under-appreciated pieces that Houston has assembled, there is plenty of talk around what another season with &lt;strong&gt;Warren Creavalle&lt;/strong&gt; might mean to the Orange. He’s a Swiss-army-knife-like defensive piece in a love-child-like mix of &lt;strong&gt;Brad Evans&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Geoff Cameron.* &lt;/strong&gt;The former Georgia product is growing by leaps and bounds over the last 12 months. He may not be a clear cut choice to start at this point for the Dynamo’s XI, but he’s going to be the first player off the bench to fill into just about any position in the midfield or defensive back line, and that flexibility has huge value over an entire season. &lt;em&gt;*Editor’s note: The editor is just going to let this sit there.&lt;/em&gt; The remaining question is how Will Bruin performs in 2014. The dancing bear should be good for about 10 goals or more this season. He’s put up near 3 shots per 90 minutes played each of the past two years, and while those chances becoming goals is dependent more on location, he’s seen a bit of bad luck strike him at times where, in the year previous, those balls bounced his way. Paired along side English journeyman Giles Barnes—who looks to have perhaps found a home this past year, scoring 9 goals on 97 shots through 2500 minutes—Houston has multiple wonder-strikers from distance. It’s one thing to be lucky; it’s another to find goals because of the courage to continue to fire the shots. The Dynamo found a way to keep the group of players they recruited for 2013 together for another run of it in 2014, despite declining payroll and allocation funds. They’ve got youth on their side with a touch of growing strength, added to one of the most brilliant coaches in the league managing them. I wouldn’t be surprised if they had a top-3 finish with a boring run through the schedule. The other side of things is that they’re going to have a tough time of it with the likes of Philadelphia, Toronto, DC and even Columbus all being improved sides, that they could end up on the outside looking in when the playoffs come rolling around. It’s definitely a tough year to be in the East. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Philadelphia Union is a club that doesn’t have much in the way of a history. That isn’t a knock.  But what they have done is built off plenty of American Soccer history that surrounds Chester, PA. They’ve taken time to acknowledge the roots that were here in the country long before MLS and even NASL, embroidering the once famous American club &lt;a href=&quot;http://bethlehemsteelsoccer.org/index.html&quot;&gt;Bethlehem Steel&lt;/a&gt; logo on both the back and inside of their third kit introduced last season. This is easily one of my favorite things about any third kit out there. Now with their roots going into the community, the club has targeted 2014 as the year they want to start establishing more of their own history. &lt;strong&gt;2013 Finish: 46 points; Sixth place in Eastern Conference, Missed MLS playoffs &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/phil11.png&quot; alt=&quot;Phil11&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2014-preview&quot;&gt;2014 Preview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/phil-roster.png&quot; alt=&quot;phil-roster&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/phiinfo1.png?w=182&quot; alt=&quot;PHIINFO&quot;&gt; The Union are not a club short on questions. Are they too young? Can &lt;strong&gt;Maurice Edu&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Austin Berry&lt;/strong&gt; be enough to limit the WW-II-like gun fire shots that destroyed &lt;strong&gt;Zach MacMath&lt;/strong&gt;‘s confidence and their play-off chances in 2013? Can Jack Mac finally score goals on a consistent basis? Oh, and can someone finally explain what the heck is #DOOP? The club won only three of its last 12 games over the final three months, compiling a paltry total of 12 points over that period. I think it’s kind of funny that the Union’s answer to that would be to seemingly to kick their young goalkeeper in the balls. Maybe that’s not entirely fair to the front office, as picking up goalkeeper &lt;strong&gt;Andre Blake&lt;/strong&gt; wasn’t necessarily about improving right now, or even about MacMath’s performance last season. Yet it seems, albeit a bit unfairly, that some of the blame of their collapse is attributed to him and how he performed. Again, I’m not down with that narrative that MacMath had a direct hand in the club flailing about at the end. Surrendering 14 goals over a 12 game stretch and not winning is less about how one individual performed and more about the team as a whole. It’s important to understand that goal totals over any specific time period isn’t ever a true representation of talent, as it’s impossible to say from that tally how many shots were attempted and the quality of them. If the opposition only fired 14 shots over those 12 games and they were from outrageous locations, such as some where deep in the midfield, then we’d all be appalled with his lack of skill. This isn’t the case with MacMath and the reality is that during that time the Zolos went five games without scoring, and their opponents went seven games without scoring. While there was disappointment by the fan base, I feel that the front office tried to fix something that wasn’t broken. Sure, they upgraded the defense, and adding Maurice Edu to the midfield is only going to further help and strengthen that back line. These were all general problems that weren’t going to be real hampers when considering whether they had enough talent to get into the playoffs. I’ve already mentioned the whole problem of dropping points due to the lack of goals, and the goal-scoring drought of Jack McInerney certainly did not help. Going from June to October without scoring goals was a deeply frustrating time for the striker, as he’d admitted in several interviews. Only 21 years old, he’s already seen time with the USMNT being called up to the Gold Cup roster. Though remaining uncapped, it was a great opportunity for the young striker. Unfortunately, his return to Philly seems to coincide with the point where he completely “collapsed.” Now, &lt;a href=&quot;http://11tegen11.net/2014/02/15/how-to-scout-a-striker/&quot;&gt;people are still trying to identify whether&lt;/a&gt; or not goal-scoring ability is really about putting a ball where you want it versus the quantity/quality of the shots that are generated by the individual. I’m personally of the belief that there has to be an in between for those two possibilities. Though at the professional level the question of whether or not it matters, or if there exist significant finishing gaps between strikers, is an interesting discussion. McInerney is obviously one of these strange cases to consider. Bestowed as the ‘American Chicharito’ it’s been said that he’s always in the right place at the right time. This is basically the secret to Wondolowski’s success, and it might highlight why he also went through his own scoring drought, but I think it also has something to do with the lack of support from the midfield creating chances. The additions of both Cristian Maidana and Vincent Nogueira suggests that this year’s midfield will be an improved one for creating goal-scoring opportunities. While it’s impossible to say how these new imports will fair in MLS, we’ve seen success from other attacking midfield Argentinians over the last couple of years, and it will be interesting to see if Maidana will follow in the foot steps of Morales and Valeri.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Soccer in San Jose has a unique history, going back to the Clash earning MLS’s first ever victory in 1996. The franchise changed its name to the Earthquakes in 1999, and a few years later it started winning MLS Cups thanks to a Landon Donovan-sized gift from Bayer Leverkusen. A young Donovan helped to lead San Jose to MLS Cup wins in 2001 and 2003. But after the 2005 season, the ownership group grew tired of failing to embezzle funds from Silicon Valley’s tax payers and moved head coach Dominic Kinnear and the rest of the team to Houston. The Earthquakes were not reborn until the 2008 season, and since then they have been mired in a streak of mostly 6th and 7th-place finishes, with an out-of-the-blue, historic 2012 season sprinkled in.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose_Earthquakes&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A franchise empathetic to the Buffalo Bills, Atlanta Braves, and every team that chased the Chicago Bulls in the 90’s, the Revs have shown over their 16-year history in the league that they are perpetual contenders and forever runners-up—-a key member of the ‘almost was there’ club. That was harsh, but I don’t mean to be. The club, with just a little bit of support from Robert Kraft, could have been—-and still could be—-a super power in MLS. The trio of Clint Dempsey, Shalrie Joseph, and Steve Ralston, and then the often forgotten (outside of New England) prowess of Taylor Twellman dominated the mid 00’s period of MLS, and New England reached the MLS Cup finals on four different occasions between 2002 and 2007. Now, after a couple of down years, the franchise has reloaded and found itself a new era of young up-and-comers a decade later. &lt;strong&gt;2013 Review: 51 Points, 3rd in the Eastern Conference, lost to Sporting Kansas City in Conference Semis&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/newenglandxi.png&quot; alt=&quot;newenglandXI&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

2013 opened for the Revs with expectations of justhoping to make the Wildcard round. Really, anything better than finishing above Toronto was the end goal, and while maybe I’m slightly exaggerating the situation a bit, I don’t think many thought they would finish 3rd in the East. &lt;strong&gt;Jay Heaps&lt;/strong&gt; definitely sat upon a seat of growing embers, and fans were gradually getting more and more anxious to see progression from their second-year manager after replacing long-term icon &lt;strong&gt;Steve Nicol&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey guys and gals. You like Major League Soccer, right? Of course you do! Why else would you be here? And how do you feel about contests? Fun, right? And what would a contest be without a fabulous prize? Well, American Soccer Analysis will be running a prediction contest over the first two weeks of the 2014 MLS season, and &lt;strong&gt;the winner will receive a subscription to MLS LIVE&lt;/strong&gt; for the 2014 season. Here’s how it will work… On both Monday, March 3 and Monday, March 10, American Soccer Analysis will post 10 questions about the forthcoming week’s Major League Soccer and CONCACAF Champions League games. Just follow us on Twitter, use your master prognostication abilities, submit your answers using our form, and whoever has the most correct total answers after the second week of games will win a subscription to MLS LIVE for this season. It’s that easy. (Well, except for the tiebreaker, which will be asked in week two in the event that multiple people finish with the same score.) Do you have to be following &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AnalysisEvolved&quot;&gt;@AnalysisEvolved&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter to win the prize? Yes. Is this a shameful attempt to drive traffic to our Twitter and consequently this website? No. We feel lots of shame in doing so, but do so we must! Remember, &lt;strong&gt;only followers of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AnalysisEvolved&quot;&gt;@AnalysisEvolved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on Twitter will be eligible for the subscription to MLS Live 2014. The MLS LIVE subscription is transferrable, so if you’re already registered for this season, and you win, you can always re-gift it to a friend, or family member, or enemy who has an irrational hate for soccer. See you on Monday!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Season Preview: Colorado Rapids</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a fan of up-and-coming soccer talent, the 2013 Colorado Rapids were a squad who, seemingly out of nowhere, became a must-watch team. While the trend is for MLS teams to rely more heavily upon experienced and highly paid players to bolster their roster, Colorado, perhaps out of necessity, became a team driven by young, inexpensive talent. They used all available means to assemble their roster: trades (Edson Buddle and Nathan Sturgis), the SuperDraft (Deshorn Brown and Dillon Powers), the NASL and USL (Chris Klute and Clint Irwin, respectively), and international signings (Vicente Sanchez and Gabriel Torres). By the time the 2013 season concluded, Oscar Pareja had lead the Rapids to 51 points and the 5th seed in the Western Conference, a sizeable upgrade over their 37 points accumulated in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 Finish: 14-11-9, 51 points; 45 GF, 38 GA. Fifth place in Western Conference. Lost in Wildcard round.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Season Preview: Vancouver Whitecaps</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Vancouver Whitecaps are still one of Major League Soccer’s newest teams, as 2014 will be just their fourth season in the league. However, the franchise has already shown a penchant for rather high turnover, both among its players and coaches. Seen through an optimist’s viewpoint, this could be commendable, as the front office is never satisfied with mediocrity and clearly strives for success. From a pessimist’s point of view, the constant tinkering robs the club of any semblance of stability and contributes to the team’s mediocrity. Either way, 2014 will be a fascinating time to watch Vancouver as they look to return to the postseason. &lt;strong&gt;2013 Finish: 48 Points, 7th in the Western Conference, Missed MLS Playoffs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Season Preview: Chicago Fire</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Fire won MLS Cup in their first season in the league. They qualified for the playoffs in 12 of their first 13 seasons in MLS. But since 2010, they’ve made the postseason only once (in 2012), where they lost in the first round. For such a storied franchise, it’s clear that Chicago has underachieved for the last four years. Hopes in the Windy City are that a new coach with a history of success in MLS, Frank Yallop, will be able to turn around their fortunes and return the club to the promised land. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 Finish: 49 Points, 6th in the Western Conference, Missed MLS Playoffs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/chicagoxi.png&quot; alt=&quot;ChicagoXI&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Fire began the season looking more like kindling (sorry, that’s the only fire-related pun I’ll use in this post), losing seven of their first ten matches. But then they started making moves, both in the front office and up the table. Chicago acquired centerback &lt;strong&gt;Bakary Soumare&lt;/strong&gt; from Philadelphia and forward &lt;strong&gt;Mike Magee&lt;/strong&gt; from Los Angeles, and their ascent quickly followed. Soumare brought a much-needed solidity to the back line, and Magee played out of his mind for the remainder of the season in his hometown. After running off six matches unbeaten immediately following their acquisition, the Fire came back to Earth and narrowly missed out on the East’s final playoff spot, bowing to Montreal on a tiebreaker. The season was not without its hardware though, as Magee won the league MVP trophy, despite being traded&lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/chiinfo1.png?w=182&quot; alt=&quot;CHIINFO&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/chiinfo1.png&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;On paper, the Chicago Fire seem like they have the pieces to be a contender in the Eastern Conference. Their offseason moves didn’t floor anyone, but they do appear to have improved, both on the bench and in the coaching box. The head coach position is where Chicago made their most substantial move: out went Frank Klopas after last season, and in came &lt;em&gt;*Frank Yallop. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Yallop won two MLS Cups with the San Jose Earthquakes as well as the 2012 Supporters’ Shield, so he certainly has pedigree to match that of his new employer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Season Preview: D.C. United</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/season-preview-dc-united/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Few teams had more turnover in the offseason than DC United. With a slew of injuries last season, the worst record in MLS , and a deal for a new stadium on the verge of breaking down, things can only get better for United in 2014. Fresh off of an appearance in the 2012 Eastern Conference Finals, and with another year of experience for young players like Perry Kitchen and Nick DeLeon, 2013 was supposed to be a return to contention for the club with more trophies than any other MLS team. Instead, they finished a full 10 (!) points behind Chivas USA for last in MLS. While their third US Open Cup trophy helped alleviate some of the pain (a consolation many supporters from other clubs would covet), the team has brought in some bigger names – including an entirely new defensive line – which they hope will turn things around in 2014. &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/2-25-2014-9-11-08-am.png&quot; alt=&quot;2-25-2014 9-11-08 AM&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

United’s multiple offseason moves culminated with &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/dcuinfo1.png?w=182&quot; alt=&quot;DCUINFO&quot;&gt;winning the sweepstakes for US national team striker Eddie Johnson, a player everyone expects to outpace DC’s 2013 leading goal scorer “Own Goal” (seriously, though). Despite a -37 goal differential last year, &lt;strong&gt;[our shot location data&lt;/strong&gt;](&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/shot-locations/&quot;&gt;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/shot-locations/&lt;/a&gt;) suggests that they were a bit unlucky to finish so low. Having EJ paired with MLS veteran Fabian Espindola, DC’s strikers should score many more goals than the three Linonard Pajoy and an over-the-hill Carlos Ruiz combined for last year. The loss of Dwayne De Rosario will be felt in the midfield, but even the 2011 MVP lost his starting spot late last season. Stepping in will be former Impact captain Davy Arnaud, who will bring leadership to an otherwise young midfield. United will really hope for a healthy season from likes of Nick DeLeon and Chris Pontius who were both hampered by injuries last year, and will look to continue the progress of Canadian international Kyle Porter. Perry Kitchen returns as the backbone of a young midfield that remains mostly unchanged from 2013, but is poised to be more productive in 2014. While Klinsmann favorite Bill Hamid remains in goal, United is likely to see a 100% turnover in their defensive backline from a year ago, having brought in proven MLS defenders Sean Franklin, Bobby Boswell, and Jeff Parke, as well as Christian Fernandez, a 28 year old who comes from Almeria in Spain. By drafting Steve Birnbaum #2 overall in the SuperDraft, they also added depth and potential for the future. Franklin will provide them an attacking option up the right flank that they haven’t had since Andy Najar left the team to join Anderlecht in Belgium. Boswell and Parke will combine to bring 19 years of MLS experience to the central defense, which should give Hamid a stronger confidence in the leadership and organization in front of him. Fernandez has spent time in La Liga and Spain’s Segunda Division, and looks to bring bring a similar attacking style to the left back position, having scored 6 goals in 36 appearances for Almeria over the last two seasons. Finally, Birnbaum looks to be one of their players of the future, and will fill in for Boswell and Parke in the center of defense during a packed schedule that will include the CONCACAF Champions League in 2014. DC has taken the anti-Toronto FC route, investing across the roster rather than adding big-name DPs at a few positions. While none of their backline is cheap – United picked up Franklin in the re-entry draft because the Galaxy deemed his salary too high, and Parke isn’t a bargain either – United was able to take three of their five highest paid players off the books with the subtractions of DeRo, Jakovic, and Pajoy (who was making an inexplicable $205k per year). They have invested heavily in more experienced, and simply better defenders. With no Designated Players currently on the roster, United have managed to endure more roster turnover than nearly every other team in MLS this offseason without breaking the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Season Preview: FC Dallas</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/season-preview-fc-dallas/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past three seasons, fans of the Hoops have seen their team crash down from the high of a 2010 MLS Cup Finals appearance . In 2012, those same fans endured a 13-game winless streak, to be followed by another 11-game winless streak in 2013, resulting in Dallas missing the playoffs each of the past two seasons. What made matters worse was their red hot start to 2013, where they raced out to a 7-2-3 record and 24 points by the end of May, good for first place in the West. After missing out on the post season following such a hot start, Schellas Hyndman was shown the door (officially resigned), and former FC Dallas player and long time assistant Oscar Pareja was hired to right the ship. There is much optimism surrounding Dallas as they look to put the past behind them and get themselves back into the playoffs in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 Finish: 44 Points, 8th in the Western Conference, Missed MLS Playoffs&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/fcdallasxi.png&quot; alt=&quot;FCDallasXI&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/roster-dallas.png&quot; alt=&quot;roster-dallas&quot;&gt;Lots of optimism surround the Hoops after the theft appointment of &lt;strong&gt;Oscar&lt;/strong&gt; “Papi” &lt;strong&gt;Pareja&lt;/strong&gt; as head coach, and for good reason. The former Colorado Rapids head coach was highly regarded by the front office, was a contender for MLS &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/dalinfo1.png?w=182&quot; alt=&quot;DALINFO&quot;&gt;Coach of the Year after Colorado overachieved last season with their young roster, thanks in some part to Pareja’s guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the optimism is high, there are also some concerns with the team, as they jettisoned off a few key pieces from last year (Captain &lt;strong&gt;David Ferreira&lt;/strong&gt;, striker &lt;strong&gt;Kenny Cooper&lt;/strong&gt;, and winger &lt;strong&gt;Jackson&lt;/strong&gt;), and now FC Dallas must work through that awkward transition where new faces and a new coach try to get on the same page. Will the front office and Dallas fans be patient enough to wait for Pareja to work his magic, given they’ve missed the playoffs two season in a row now? His first season in Colorado was forgettable (11-19-4, no playoffs), but there were clear signs of improvement in his second year (14-11-9, knock out rounds).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Season Preview: Montreal Impact</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The newest franchise in Major League Soccer, the Montreal Impact, has carved out its niche pretty distinctly since inception in 2012. With strong ties to Serie A through multiple Italian players, Montreal has seen decent success for such a new franchise. They just missed the playoffs in their expansion year, and sneaked in as the five seed last year. But with the success has come another reputation: they already seem rather fond of changing coaches. Entering their third season of play, Montreal’s owner Joey Saputo is already onto his third manager, with Frank Klopas taking the wheel in 2014. &lt;strong&gt;2013 Finish: 49 Points, 5th in Eastern Conference, Qualified for MLS Cup playoff, lost in conference play-in round.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/montrealxi.png&quot; alt=&quot;MontrealXI&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Roster Churn:&lt;/strong&gt; 82.98% returning minutes (4th highest in MLS) &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/roster-montreal.png&quot; alt=&quot;roster-Montreal&quot;&gt;2013 started out about as perfect as any Impact fan could have hoped. But the team then coughed, sputtered, and wheezed its way into the wildcard round of the postseason, where th&lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/mtlinfo3.png?w=182&quot; alt=&quot;MTLINFO&quot;&gt;e coughing and wheezing turned to seizing, and Montreal’s campaign met an early demise. Marco Schallibaum’s tenure started with a bang, as Montreal won each of its first four games by one tally each, all of them by a scoreline of 1-0 or 2-1. Those close, low-scoring victories figured to set the tone for the season—-Montreal was a stout defensive team who would get bodies behind the ball and look to finish swift counter-attacks through &lt;strong&gt;Marco Di Vaio&lt;/strong&gt;. This formula helped them to win the Canadian Championship for a second year running, qualifying them for next season’s CONCACAF Champions League. Unfortunately, their tactical secret wasn’t particularly well-kept throughout the league, as opposing teams figured out how to counter the Impact’s strategy after about the first third of the season. The regular season’s final 20 games saw only five Montreal victories, as they earned just a point per game during that span while simultaneously crashing out of last year’s CCL. Still, their hot start was enough to squeeze into the Eastern Conference knockout round, as they slipped into the five seed thanks to a superior goal difference to Chicago. But the luck would run out for Schallibaum and the French-Canadian club in a hurry, as they were beaten and outclassed by the Houston Dynamo in the do-or-die playoff, 3-0. The game was as damaging to Montreal’s reputation, too, as &lt;strong&gt;Nelson Rivas&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Andres Romero&lt;/strong&gt; and Di Vaio were all ejected for various infractions. The last moments of the match devolved into more of a cat-fight than a soccer match, with the men in blue performing the side of jealous aggressors. In the end, not only was the season over but so too was Schallibaum’s tenure in Montreal; he was fired a few weeks later. I’ll be frank: it’s hard to imagine that this year’s Montreal Impact is much improved over last year’s iteration. And with seemingly every other team in the Eastern Conference signing big name Designated Players, it would follow that Montreal’s stagnation would see them drop a few rungs in the standings this season. Don’t take my word for it – just ask central defender &lt;strong&gt;Matteo Ferrari&lt;/strong&gt;. Here’s a clue for the future expansion sides in MLS: it’s never a good sign when your club has to release a statement clarifying that one of your top players is in fact on the same page as your technical director.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Season Preview: Chivas USA</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/pre-season-preview-chivas-usa/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most people would associate Chivas USA with the pinnacle of terribleness within MLS. They’ve accrued all of 56 points combined the last two seasons which barely eclipses the LA Galaxy totals, their evil timeshare neighbor, over the course of just one year. The club from the beginning has sported a feel that was awkward—-almost insulting—-and it has been a bit of an outcast from the rest of the league. Despite what we all know about them now, it’s easy to forget that as few as five years ago they were the more dominant LA brand, earning top-three finishes in 2006, 2007 and in 2008. They were lead by the likes of US internationals &lt;strong&gt;Brad Guzan&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sacha Kljestan&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Bornstein&lt;/strong&gt;. They boasted the scoring prowess of &lt;strong&gt;Ante Razov&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the premier scoring talents in MLS history, who is still the club’s all-time goal scorer. Despite the recent woes, it’s not outside the realm of possibility that they could return to a run of strong form. But it will likely need to be built upon the youth and Academy products they’ve been working to develop, as Chivas USA has been cited as one of the more talent rich organizations at the youth level. Make no mistake about it; things are just starting to get interesting in the City of Angels. &lt;strong&gt;2013 Finish: 26 points, 9th in the Western Conference, Missed Playoffs&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/chivasxi.png&quot; alt=&quot;ChivasXI&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There have been ups, and there have been downs for the Crew over the last four seasons, perhaps even more so than with other teams. Since winning MLS Cup in 2008 the departure of coach &lt;strong&gt;Sigi Schmid,&lt;/strong&gt; the club made &lt;strong&gt;Robert Warzycha&lt;/strong&gt; head coach. But then a steady fall ensued that has seen the club completely miss out on the playoffs each of the last two seasons. This led to the dismissal of long-time fixture Warzycha, who had been a part of the club since it’s inception in 1996.  Add this to the Hunt family finally selling off its ownership of the club, and you have a full docket of changes that have occurred around Crew Stadium. Unfortunately for Columbus, none these are indicators that the club will improve, at least in the short term. &lt;strong&gt;2013 Finish: 41 Points, 8th in the Eastern Conference, Missed MLS Playoffs&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/columbuslineup.png&quot; alt=&quot;ColumbusLineup&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pre-season Survey and Team Previews</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve been pestering you all by tweeting, sharing, spamming, and pretty much all-out begging for you to participate in our pre-season MLS standings survey, we feel it’s only fair that we share it with you! Thanks to you guys, we got hundreds of votes, so I first want to say thank you for all that. Thanks. Part of the exercise was to see what you all thought of how the table will shape up more than 35 weeks from now. Yes, there were transactions that happened in the middle of the polling, and it probably changed the way we thought about how to rank teams in some cases. But crazy as it might seem, the poll produced results showing definitive tiers between teams. There are a lot of various theories about how one might go about making “power rankings,” and while it’s a pretty arbitrary endeavor—-who is to say that any result is right or wrong?—-I think common sense could easily rebuff the three people who voted &lt;strong&gt;Chivas USA&lt;/strong&gt; with a #1 overall finish in the West. That’s just crazy. The other side of the exercise was to, come November, make a point. Perhaps an obvious point that can go without saying, but a point. The idea that, during the pre-season, we could accurately project standings is contemptible (but it will be interesting to see how you all do collectively). Basically, I get agitated when I see a narrative that states “Who would have seen this coming?” or when someone makes a grand claim that “No one thought ‘Team X’ was going to be this bad!” Who decided he could speak for everyone? Now, we can speak for, at least, a few hundred people at the end of the 2014 season when we say, “Who could have seen Chivas doing so well? Oh, it was you three!” (Just kidding. That won’t happen.) The individuals who participated in this project are mostly those of a select, niche community—-well, and my mom—-and you will (hopefully) help me with my agitation. Speaking now as to specific methods of organizing and ranking the standings from the poll results: if you scrape a bunch of opinions from fans of various teams and get perspectives of supporters from 400+ backgrounds and locales, I believe it’s possible that you can sift through some of the bias that often occurs when just a few people share opinions. It’s a crowdsourced cocktail made without disposition, and still delicious. While it’s far from perfect, I find it’s a pretty good barometer. While we plan on releasing the final results of the said crowd sourcing project in two weeks (March 7th), we’re also in the process of putting together our pre-season team previews. We’ve got a great pool of writers that have taken a lot of time to put this together, and have also been helping us gather data that should yield even more new statistics and analyses this year. This isn’t just about us generating content. It’s an opportunity for these guys to get a shout out for all that they’ve done. Most will be joining us on a podcast next week where you’ll get to hear from them and hopefully get an introduction of sorts. We will publish the team previews beginning this afternoon in the order in which the clubs scored on the survey, from worst to first, alternating between Eastern and Western Conference. Posts will go up each day until the beginning of the season. Happy 2014, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;american-soccer-analysis-fantasy-league&quot;&gt;American Soccer Analysis Fantasy League&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, you know how you join a fantasy league every year at the start of a season, and then you forget about it until the dying weeks of the season, once things get exciting? Well we want to you to do that in our league this year! Don’t make me beg, because I’ll do it! Oh, but you think you’re not cool enough to hang with all of us? Newsflash: our levels of fantasy intelligence and attention to our rosters could both be described as mediocre. Just like you. And wait! There’s more! The winner of this said league will win … something. I promise it’ll be something. I’ve been playing with a few ideas and regardless of what you may have heard of me, I’ve still got a few original ideas. For instance: How about a gift card to Texas Roadhouse? That place is like… awesome. You can eat peanuts and just throw it on the floor. IT’S ANARCHY! True story: I once ate there on thanksgiving and it was okay. I’m a story teller, what can I say? Oh, what’s that? Texas Roadhouse gift card isn’t the coolest thing in the world? You have a peanut allergy? You live in Texas and that’s just a normal day for you? No problemo. We’ll trash that idea. I never liked it any how. What about a trip to Disneyland?!? Oh, wait. &lt;em&gt;Opens wallet&lt;/em&gt; Nope, can’t do that. We’re still poor. Okay. Whatever the prize, and I’ll make sure it’s good, you could win it, and you’ll be like, “this was so worth the five minutes of setting my line-up while  some guy cries at his computer and screams in all caps ‘I SPENT MORE THAN 10 HOURS A WEEK RESEARCHING TO WIN THIS DUMB LEAGUE.’” And you’ll laugh—-hell we’ll all laugh—-because remember: we don’t remember to check our line-ups either. All you have to do is log in to mlssoccer.com, go to the fantasy section,  join private league, and enter code &lt;strong&gt;9593-1668&lt;/strong&gt; to enter into this esteemed gathering of nerds that will probably talk a much bigger game than they are actually capable of backing up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Don’t get too excited about the title. We really don’t go into this nearly as much as we probably should have. We draw a lot of our thoughts from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://11tegen11.net/2014/02/10/what-is-expg/&quot;&gt;11tegen11 article&lt;/a&gt; that sets the table nicely for the discussion, and we just kind of build around that. The audio for the first portion is a little maddening. We had a few problems, but everything was cleared up after about the first 20 minutes, so don’t be deterred from finishing this one. There are some good points made by Drew and me, if I may say so, which make it well worth a listen.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago the Opta Pro Forum took place and this week we take a look at some of the different studies that came as a result and some key thoughts that we pulled out of them. Covering such a wide range of topics we invited site friend Chris Gluck to talk with us about some of these various subjects. It was a lot of fun and I think we covered some interesting topics. During the podcast we also mention the movement of Hendry Thomas, who goes from Colorado to Dallas and the current status of Matias Laba with Toronto FC and his impending move away from the club. Enjoy!

      <title>Calculating Expected Goal Differential 1.0</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/calculating-expected-goal-differential-1-0/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/calculating-expected-goal-differential-1-0/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The basic premise of expected goal differential is to assess how dangerous a team’s shots are, and how dangerous its opponent’s shots are. A team that gets a lot of dangerous shots inside the box, but doesn’t give up such shots on defense, is likely to be doing something tactically or skillfully, and is likely to be able to reproduce those results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge to creating expected goal differential (xGD), then, is to obtain data that measures the difficulty of each shot all season long. Our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/shot-locations/&quot;&gt;xGD 1.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; utilized six zones on the field to parse out the dangerous shots from those less so. Soon, we will create xGD 2.0 in which shots are not only sorted by location, but also by body part (head vs. foot) and by run of play (typical vs. free kick or penalty). Obviously kicked shots are more dangerous than headed shots, and penalty kicks are more dangerous than other shots from zone two, the location just behind the six-yard box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, for the calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the entire league, for all 8,291 shots taken in 2013, we calculate the proportion of shots from each zone that were finished (scored):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Shots&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Finish%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One
129
415
31.1%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two
451
2547
17.7%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three

51
2190
2.3%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six
5
142
3.5%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that shots from zones one and two are the most dangerous, while shots from farther out or from wider angles are less dangerous. To calculate a team’s offensive “dangerousness,” we count the number of shots each team attempted from each zone, and then multiply each total by the league’s finishing rate. As an example, here we have Sporting Kansas City’s offensive totals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locations&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Attempts&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Finish%&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;ExpGoals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;490&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;9.2%&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;48.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offensively, if SKC had finished at the league average rate from each respective zone, then it would have scored about 48 goals. Now let’s focus on SKC’s defensive shot totals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locations&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Attempts&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Finish%&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;ExpGoals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;30&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;306&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;9.8%&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;29.8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defensively, had SKC allowed the league average finishing rate from each zone, it would have allowed about 30 goals (incidentally, that’s exactly what it did allow, ignoring own goals).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subtracting expected goals against from expected goals for, we get a team’s expected goal differential. Expected goal differential works so well as a predictor because teams are more capable of repeating their ability to get good (or bad) shots for themselves, and allow good (or bad) shots to their opponents. An extreme game in which a team finishes a high percentage of shots won’t sway that team’s xGD, nor that of its opponents, making xGD a better indicator of “true talent” at the team level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for xGD 2.0, coming soon to a laptop near you, the main difference is that there will be additional shot types to consider. Instead of just six zones, now there will be six zones broken down by headed and kicked shots (12 total zones) in addition to free kick—-and possibly even penalty kick—-opportunities (adding, at most, four more shot types). As with xGD 1.0, a team’s attempts for each type of shot will be multiplied by the league’s average finishing rates, and then those totals will be summed to find expected goals for and expected goals against.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re back with the podcast! We return to review the snooze-fest that was the US Mens game last weekend. Stepping our big toe into a bit of the pre-season waters and turn the talk to some of the major moves around MLS and some of the clubs we’ve seen improve the most over the last few months. Lastly we give you a bit of insight to what’s going on with the site and perhaps something to watch for in the coming months. Enjoy!

      <title>Crowdsourcing the Western and Eastern Conferences</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/crowdsourcing-the-western-and-eastern-conferences/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past off-season we’ve put a lot of time into the project of obtaining shot data from the 2013 season. We’ve mentioned this before, and I’m sure you keep coming back waiting and expecting it to be here. We hope to release that soon. We are closing in on completing the data set, and once done, the data will be used to create goalkeeping ratings, game states analysis, and many other things that I haven’t yet really mentioned. We (read: Matthias) are all extremely anxious to get started. But while we are winding down that project and getting ready for the regular season of MLS—-and don’t forget NASL—-we have a pre-season exercise that we would like to conduct this month. This will be a brief and simple survey that tells us how you think each respective conference will finish after the regular season. This endeavor almost certainly won’t lead to a perfect prediction of the final standings, but hey, maybe it will be close? &lt;strong&gt;Take the survey here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/6KS3CL6&quot;&gt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/6KS3CL6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The intended use is to give a short snapshot of how we all view teams at this stage of the season. Recent outcomes seem to distort perceived notions and ideas that we originally had about something to the point that we’re not sure what we thought prior to the occurrence of that specific event. It would seem our doubt is closely followed and probably facilitated by people claiming that it “wasn’t a surprise that Montreal jumped out to an early lead in the East” or that “you shouldn’t have been shocked to see D.C. United in the cellar.” After something occurs, it’s easy to feel like things were once forgone conclusions, even if beforehand it would have been hard to rationalize a one-dollar bet on that outcome. Most of the time it’s just an arrogant (and probably ignorant, too) pundit that would choose to speak for the entirety of those that enjoy and follow U.S.-based soccer. But, let me ask you, would you have guessed that the Timbers were going to be the #1 team in the West last year? A team that, despite it’s dedicated following, looked miserable just one season ago. Who would have guessed that LA was nearly a wild card team? Think about the fact that &lt;strong&gt;Landon Donovan,&lt;/strong&gt; who rightfully had been restored to the US Mens National Team roster, was in his best form in years and the Galaxy barely missed the single elimination match to get into the playoffs. Here is a more current example: There is no doubt in my mind that Philadelphia Union supporters, the Sons of Ben and Co., believe that they will be a top-3 club in the East. Yet, judging from the incredibly small sample size of the survey I’ve sent out, most don’t believe they’re a playoffs team at this point, and some even believe they are the worst team in the East. I admit that these votes were cast before the announcement of key additions &lt;strong&gt;Maurice Edu&lt;/strong&gt; and&lt;strong&gt; Vincent Nogueira&lt;/strong&gt;, both of whom are primed to make sizable contributions to their new club. But that underlines that fact that maybe we missed something. Maybe there are things that with overlooked in this fast and furious off-season. This is your opportunity to influence things and make your voice heard. With most major European transfer windows closing this past weekend, the waters of MLS will settle and the rosters will start to set. It doesn’t eliminate the possibility of an impact talent still signing with the league; there are interesting players in leagues that still have windows open. Regardless, we are starting to gain an idea of the starting line-ups that in turn help us reference the order in which we could see clubs finish, and this gives us our best chance at making an intelligent and informed decision. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/6KS3CL6&quot;&gt;link to the survey&lt;/a&gt; is below and will be available from now until the 21st of February. We have a very optimistic level of participation that we’d like to see which means that we’re going to need some help to meet those obscured and honestly, pretty randomly chosen goals. This is the part where we selfishly push this on you as “the only way we can do this.” It’s an old—-and maybe a bit contrived—-tactic, sure. But the truth is that while we could be satisfied with the anywhere between 100 and as many as 250 unique and steadfast visitors that we have to this site, we won’t be. We need more help. I’ll assume you have friends or people that would pass-off as such—-Google calls them “acquaintances.” I’d also suspect that you have a new-fangled social media option which you prefer. All I would simply ask is that you take this survey and then share it with others. Whether you love your Twitter like a new-born baby, or shun it as you should Eddie Johnson, tweet this baby out.  The more voices that we hear, the better the picture becomes, and the less probable it is that some idiot just comes and nukes your favorite team just because he’s a supporter from an opposing club. &lt;strong&gt;Take the survey: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/6KS3CL6&quot;&gt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/6KS3CL6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; *Please bare in mind you only get one vote. Just one. Use it wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vegas Posts Odds on MLS Cup 2014</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m not usually interested in sports betting. I think most would find that surprising because we run an analytics site, and most analytics fit jointly, at least in Europe, with gambling. I avoid gambling for numerous reasons, but in general because I like the money I have and would hate to lose it.  However, there is a bit of value in looking at the betting lines and understanding which teams are favorites and why. It can give us a bit of early insight into who people consider “the best” teams. In case you missed it, Las Vegas odd makers metaphorically walked to the front of the class room and posted the first pre-season grades, identifying who they believe to the best teams in MLS. Basically they painted big red targets on the back of the LA Galaxy and Sporting Kansas City going forward. Here is a little snap shot of the complete lines, &lt;a href=&quot;http://prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com/2014/01/27/early-odds-for-2014-mls-cup-champions-are-out/&quot;&gt;courtesy of Steve Davis and NBCSports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;http://nbcprosoccertalk.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/mls-cup-odds.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; Here are few things that pop out at me just looking at this list. First, the LA Galaxy are a club that we liked a lot going into the MLS Cup. We ranked them second in terms of the probability of winning the Supporters Shield and then third in the likelihood of winning the end of season tournament. Being cast aside by Real Salt Lake in the first round was not unimaginable, and yet it kind of took us all back for a moment. It’s not surprising to me that they probably hoist the imaginary pre-season trophy at this point. Second, Portland and Seattle are neck and neck in odds. If you thought the rivalry between these two I-5 teams culminated with the playoff match, you have another thing coming. This season is going to be rife with parity, and the difference between the 1st seed and the 5th could be substantially less than what it’s been in a number of years. This is only going to throw more wood on the fire for clubs like Seattle and Portland, creating an even more tension filled stadium. Oh, hey Vancouver, you’re there also… your just not “there” yet. Third, Toronto goes from being on the worst teams in the league to big signings and having the 8th best odds to come home with silverware at the end of the season. The tides look on the brink of turning in the Queen City and could yield a very fun summer for the Reds. Some thing well deserved for their fans with the incredible support shown through some disappointing years, and really since their arrival to MLS in 2008. Lastly, who could blame you if really you wanted to throw five dollars down on DC United. Eddie Johnson/Fabian Espindola, a rebuilt back line, and young potential US internationals in Perry Kitchen and Bill Hamid. 50-1 odds? Heck, I may just throw 20 dollars on them and become a season long United fan.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>More rambling thoughts on formations</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/more-rambling-thoughts-on-formations/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/more-rambling-thoughts-on-formations/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A big thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sounderatheart.com/2014/1/25/5346144/training-camp-day-one-style-to-come-oba-gets-chippy-trialists-galore&quot;&gt;Dave Clark (or to whomever he got them from) of Sounder[at]Heart&lt;/a&gt;, from whom I’m about to rip the following quotes. &lt;/em&gt; Today during an pre-season opening presser with the media, Seattle Sounders head coach Sigi Schmid addressed questions concerning his roster construction and the possibilities of what type of formations the team could deploy this season. This is a pressing matter among most Sounders supporters who are attempting to peer inside the tactics of this unusual off-season of maneuvers for the club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have an idea, as in terms of what we want to do. We want to play two upfront. We think we’re better with two upfront and Dempsey, I think, is more effective when he has two guys in front of him… It’s like I always say, people get too hung up in ‘Is it a diamond midfield? Is it a 4-4-2? Is it a 4-2-3-1?’ It’s all about how players play on different parts of the field. Players like to play in certain areas of the field and they like to drift to certain areas. We just need to construct a system, if you want to call it that, and place guys on the field where they can compliment each other and be able to take advantage of where they like to play and what they do well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I love this because I think it truly reflects the current incarnation of soccer. Players are smarter now and more endowed with Soccer IQ than what they were years ago. Finding players that function best in certain areas of the field where your team needs it most should be the goal of any front office. I always loved &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/03/01/armchair-analyst-why-we-often-miss-point-when-we-talk-formations&quot;&gt;this quote&lt;/a&gt; from Dominic Kinnear, who told Matthew Doyle, the MLS Soccer Armchair Analyst, “You either have the ball or you don’t, I’m not a big fan of talking formations.” There is just so much awesomeness there in the sense that Dom takes a complicated intrinsic function of the coach, and instead of further vague direction, he simplifies it. Again, I’ve said it before that formations and placement matter. There was a reason that Seattle struggled last year when they used Adam Moffat in an awkward and unfamiliar location as they attempted to implement a diamond formation in an effort accentuate the talents of newly acquired Clint Dempsey. This ended up a bad decision for quite a few different reasons, outside of the fact that Adam Moffat just wasn’t very good in his appearances at that position. Another problem with the Sounders last season was their problem with certain players drifting across various places on the pitch, where I don’t think the coaching staff had planned for them to be. This caused problems early in the season despite the level of talent at their disposal. A specific example would be Mario Martinez and his tendency to wander. This might not have been factored or accounted for as they deployed him to wide positions. Maybe they had expectations of him residing as a true winger in the vein of Mauro Rosales. I’m not sure this is specifically an issue so much as, if it’s taken into account, you just get players to drift into the open spaces that are created with that movement. You can call this a free flowing system or a variety of many other things. I suppose it doesn’t really matter all that much. The important take away is that you have a method in place to score goals and prevent them from being scored against you. Whether you choose to exercise a formation to best do that or not, we’re all judged by results. It’ll be interesting to see how the Dynamo and Sounders continue to develop over the 2014 season.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please welcome to our little team of analysists and helpers Chris Gluck, whose PWP is going to be added to the metrics table this year—-a solid instrument in telling us how teams have performed in turning possession into goals. Currently it’s one of the best _open-source _metrics out there to tell us such things. I hope you’ll enjoy his contributions as much I will - Harrison&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;First things first —- my thanks to Harrison Crow and Matthias Kullowatz for the opportunity to post my Possession with Purpose Introduction on American Soccer Analysis.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’ve been following me this past year through &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.columbian.com/portland-timbers/&quot;&gt;Columbian Newspaper&lt;/a&gt;--out of southern Washington—you’ll know that I’ve been researching statistics in Major League Soccer. My intent has been to develop a simplified (Strategic) set of team performance indicators that may help others better understand soccer and how the outcome of a game may be better understood based on the primary inputs to the game.  Data for my research comes from documenting and analyzing all 646 MLS Regular Season games in 2013; the source data originates with OPTA and is displayed on the MLS Chalkboard and the MLS Statistics Sheet found through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mlssoccer.com/&quot;&gt;www.mlssoccer.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;With that here’s my introduction on Possession with Purpose… &lt;/strong&gt; To first understand the context, I offer that this is one of the End States of my effort: &lt;em&gt;create a simplified approach and documented method for measuring team performance where the output is an Index that (while excluding points) comes close to matching results in the MLS League Table&lt;/em&gt;. Beginning with that End State in mind here is the End State product: &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/pic1.jpg?w=890&quot; alt=&quot;pic1&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Observations from the Diagram…&lt;/strong&gt; Note that 9 of the top 10 teams in this Index made the MLS Playoffs last year with the Houston Dynamo finishing 12th in the Index.  For comparison, in benchmarking whoscored.com their Index only had 8 of their top 10 teams make the Playoffs, while www.squawka .com matched my 90% success rating, but the team they missed in the top 10 (New England) finished 16th in their Index. From a strategic standpoint, the End State objective has been met; &lt;em&gt;create a simplified approach and documented method for measuring team performance where the output is an Index that (while excluding points) comes close to matching results in the MLS League Table&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;strong&gt;Defining the PWP Attacking and Defending Processes…&lt;/strong&gt; Here are the six steps in the PWP Strategic Attacking Process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain possession of the ball,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retain possession and move the ball,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Penetrate &amp;amp; create goal scoring opportunities,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take shots when provided goal scoring opportunities,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put those shots taken on goal,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Score the goal.
Here are the six steps in the PWP Strategic Defending Process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimize opponent gaining possession of the ball,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize opponent retaining possession and moving the ball,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize opponent penetrating and creating goal scoring opportunities,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize opponent taking shots when provided goal scoring opportunities,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize opponent putting those shots on goal,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize opponent scoring the goal.
Every step is this process has an average success rate (percentage) based upon data gathered from all 646 MLS Regular Season games. &lt;strong&gt;Understanding the context of these steps versus other conditions and activities that influence the outcome of a game…&lt;/strong&gt; In case you missed it I call these Processes and the Indices “Strategic” to separate their value/meaning relative to other things that can influence the outcome of a game. For me I have two other ways to classify information that can influence the outcomes in those steps. I have Operational conditions and Tactical metrics; provided below are some examples of each:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Operational conditions&lt;/em&gt;: Scheme of maneuver a team uses in setting up their system, such as flat-back four, flat-back three, double-pivot midfield, single-pivot midfield, bunkering with counterattacking, pressing high, direct attacking, possession-oriented attacking, weather conditions, location of the game (home/away), conference foe, non-conference foe, etc…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical metrics&lt;/em&gt;: Locations of shots taken, shots on goal, and goals scored; penalty kicks, free kicks, crosses, headers won/lost, tackles won/lost, interceptions, clearances, blocked crosses, blocked shots, etc. 
The diagram below shows the PWP Strategic Attacking Process with the average percentage of success rate in MLS for 2013. A more detailed explanation of each step is provided below the diagram. &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/pic2.jpg?w=890&quot; alt=&quot;pic2&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Gain possession of the ball:&lt;/strong&gt; The intent behind this basic step should be clear; you can’t win the game if you don’t possess the ball to some extent. A second consideration about this step is that the more you possess the ball the less your opponent possesses the ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a defensive standpoint there are any number of ways a team can work to gain possession of the ball; they include, but are not limited to, tackling, intercepting, clearing the ball, winning fifty-fifty duels on the ground or in the air, or simply gathering a loose ball based upon a deflection or bad pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/possession-with-purpose-an-introduction-and-some-explanations/#235&quot; title=&quot;2014-02-27 15:19:05&quot;&gt;Phil Luetchford&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Would “failed assists” be the same as Opta’s “key passes,” thereby making “chances created” the metric you are looking for in Step 4? That still wouldn’t cover times where the shot never went off, like in your example. Your formula of Shots Taken/Completed Passes in the Attacking Third is a measure of how direct that team is playing. I expected to see Chances Created somewhere in Step 3 or 4 and am wondering how you managed to avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/possession-with-purpose-an-introduction-and-some-explanations/#204&quot; title=&quot;2014-01-17 10:24:57&quot;&gt;chrisgluck&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks for your comments and great to hear you enjoyed it as much as you did. :) Your thoughts on location are important to consider - there are many folks out there that already do great work on analyzing shot locations and I think you may see some pretty cool stuff on this site in the next few months as well. For me, and this effort, Shot locations falls under Tactical Metrics so the location itself won’t appear as Strategic measurement. As the PWP effort is expanded the shot location will become a feeder into the larger success rate percentages. Not sure how well that reads but think of it as an onion - the whole onion are the 6 steps and within each of those steps there are layers that influence the outcome - sometimes tactical metrics like ‘tackles’ will influence more than one step - shot locations should influence the final three steps so they will be reviewed over time to see their influence in those six steps. I hope that helps? You are also correct about the score-line influencing activities on the pitch - for me, the score-line change is an Operational condition of the game when it occurs. In earlier work on PWP I noted that as the scoreline changed a number of activities were influenced and if down 1-nil; 2-nil with 10-15 minutes to go a team that is possession-oriented is likely to apply more direct attacking… this condition will slightly skew the data so it’s important to know when that happens. As I’m only one guy I don’t have the time to get into that level of detail yet :). Another great challenge for many of us stats guys is that the open-source data folks make it very hard for us to separate out simple stats given a score-line change; perhaps that will change in the near future? All the best and keep up your research! Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/possession-with-purpose-an-introduction-and-some-explanations/#203&quot; title=&quot;2014-01-17 00:06:17&quot;&gt;jaredeyoung&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m so impressed I want to cry. This is really incredible. I’ve been thinking of a similar “process” for the work I want to do but this blows it away. I will probably continue to work on my more simplified approach but know that I am defeated :) I am surprised you don’t factor in the location of the shot as an important factor in creating value. More passes in the final third should lead to a better shot and therefore more goals. Also, if you look at the score of the game when the shot was taken you can get a proxy for defensive pressure being applied in the final 3rd. There’s a great post on 11tegen11.net that works through that. Could be something to add in the future. But this is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/possession-with-purpose-an-introduction-and-some-explanations/#206&quot; title=&quot;2014-01-19 02:00:30&quot;&gt;Harrison Crow&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; As Chris allueded to, ASA will be presenting a lot of really exciting and detailed information with shot locations and game states that will only further influence this type of work by people like Chris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/possession-with-purpose-an-introduction-and-some-explanations/#236&quot; title=&quot;2014-02-27 16:25:25&quot;&gt;chrisgluck&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Phil, Great question(s) and this may take a few minutes to answer - “failed assists” includes more than just Opta Key Passes - at least the key passes that have been offered up and defined in the MLS Chalkboard. I also believe Opta makes a judgment call ‘after’ a pass is made to determine whether or not it was ‘key’; I disagree with this judgmental decision - any pass into the box is ‘key’ - what makes it more or less key is how well the defenders versus attackers manage that pass… does that make sense? In a regular football environment, for me as a coach, any cross offered up into the 18 yard box is an opportunity for a teammate to take it and score from it - in counting key passes in Opta they are also not included in that definition of a key pass. And interestingly enough crosses that are successful are not even counted as ‘successful passes’ in Opta either. But as noted in the article unsucessful crosses are counted as ‘unsuccessful passes’. So without having detailed information on the ‘stream of passes working towards a shot taken’ the only strategic recourse is to look for a general relationship between passes made (successful and unsuccessful as appropriate) to shots taken. At least that way the approach is consistent for all the teams in MLS. ‘Chances created’ is not quite the same as ‘goal scoring opportunities created’; for me a ‘chance created’ is where the teammate has latched onto the ball and taken a shot - I am looking at more than just that - I also want to be able to glean how effective the defense was in preventing that GSO from becoming a ‘chance created’ - for me a ‘chance created’ would be derived from minusing out ‘defensive activities like defensive clearances. So in essence I didn’t manage to avoid that I simply can’t collect it at this time given the data that is available. But also note that my calculation includes ‘successful passes’ so by using that I am separating out defensive activities that result in an unsuccessful pass. If you read some of my earlier articles on possession with purpose, on my blog site, the first 15 - 20 games or so I did specifically collect that data for Portland - and there is clear evidence that possession, penetration, creation of goal scoring opportunities (as I’d like to define them), defensive clearances, shots taken, shots on goal and goals scored had a very strong inter-relationship with each other - my R2 for that curvelinear relationship was .987. The R2 at that time for the simple ‘goals scored’ hovered around .6000 or so - clearly reinforcing that the ‘collective analysis of multiple data points in a stream of possession’ outweigh the value of just one data point (goals scored). But that data was hand collected for every Timbers match and is not/was not available across all MLS teams - so I had to adjust to establish an equal playing field to analyze in order to create the Indices I had intended on creating. Hence the decision to work with shots taken versus completed passes. I do suggest that this adjusted approach is not perfect :) as I statistically already know this given my previous (single focused) analysis on the Timbers. So in answer to your last consideration is chances created somewhere in step 3 or 4, yes - with my individual research on Portland last year step 3 is ‘physical penetrations’ (counts) and step 4 is ‘goal scoring opportunities created’ (counts) (inbetween there are the defensive activities/clearances that occur prior to the shot being taken). I also tracked what side (left right or middle) where the penetration occured and then (left right or middle) where the GSO occured and what type of GSO was used - cross, free kick, corner, throughball, switch, long ball from square 1, etc) That being said, and the lack of global data for all MLS teams using that criteria, I had to adjust in considering the overall output (the Index generated). Even in adjusting there remains a statistical relationship that can and does have relevance to an End State in comparison to the final league tables. 90% accuracy is on the same par as having an R2 of .9000. I would offer that if statistical analyses are to be leveraged to better understand teams then the statistical data collected and offered freely to the public needs to get better. Others besides myself, Ted Knutson, have noted that the Opta data could be a whole lot better… so I didn’t manage to avoid that approach - I simply couldn’t execute that approach outside of just analyzing the Timbers… I hope that answers your question and it may provide more than you want to know :) Feel free to contact me anytime Phil - always love chatting about trying to get better, more relevant data, from Opta…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/possession-with-purpose-an-introduction-and-some-explanations/#237&quot; title=&quot;2014-02-27 17:46:50&quot;&gt;chrisgluck&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Phil, One other important consideration here is that ‘chances created’ and then ‘shots taken’ is geared more to a ‘tactical success’ rate of a particular player as opposed to the strategic team performance index that GSO’s look at - for example - there are superb stats out there on whose taking shots, putting them on target and then scoring - what is missing is the ‘team’ creation of those opportunities that can come from anywhere by anyone - even the goal keeper on a long ball (assist or failed assist) - to support that ball striker on a collective basis. Put another way - within this strategic approach there are ‘operational considerations’ that influence the game and then ‘tactical details’ that influence the game - how well an individual striker executes that tactical step falls up under the difference between GSOs created and those that are stopped by team defense (clearances, interceptions etc) as well as the individual ability of the striker… guess what I am trying to say is consider the phrase ‘chances created’ falls up under ‘tactical metrics’ that support or can be influenced by operational metrics that tuck up under ‘strategic indicators’ - does that help clarify?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Should we judge the Eastern and Western Conferences As Independent Leagues within MLS?</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I kind of alluded to this on &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2014/01/02/asa-podcast-xxxiiii-the-one-where-we-talk-2013-defenses-eastern-conference/&quot;&gt;Podcast XXXIV&lt;/a&gt; last week, but I wanted to start a conversation this week in regards to the very question that’s been ringing in my ears. With the alignment changes in regards to the CONCACAF Champions League bids, it puts a new emphasis on winning your conference in 2014 rather than the Supporters Shield—-which in times past has conflicted MLS between being conference-based system or as being a single-table entity. Now, with all these changes occurring, is there a reason to look at these two entities within Major League Soccer as being the same? It’s obvious that there was a split or a line drawn between three different echelons (good, meh and poor) within the Eastern Conference where in the West it was much tighter and distinct between who was good and who was… well, bad. When we enter 2014 and start looking at predictions, obviously you have to look at the picture as a whole and take into consideration and account for the inclusion of as many possible influences and pieces that could affect an outcome. That said, is it fair to compare the New York Red Bulls to the LA Galaxy anymore, or even compare Toronto FC to Chivas USA? These teams will have fewer and fewer overlapping influences, meaning that their results and outcomes are more conference-centric, right? It’s an interesting thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/should-we-judge-the-eastern-and-western-conferences-as-indepdent-leagues-within-mls/#200&quot; title=&quot;2014-01-11 09:52:54&quot;&gt;Harrison Crow&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, the race is obviously about who can claim the most points and by that perspective I suppose it wouldn’t matter. However, Sporting doesn’t need to have more points than Portland to get into the CCL so in that context why should we compare the two? They are similar clubs but the only time they are competing against each other, really, is during the MLS Cup and that’s a tournament and functions much different in a predictive model. LA Galaxy could have the second most points in MLS and not win a CCL bid or win a trophy, likewise Toronto very well could end up with the third most points in the table and come away with both. I’ll agree that I don’t think most teams probably don’t see the CCL as an extra incentive but they should. Clubs such as Houston, DC, Portland, RSL, LA, Seattle and Sporting have experienced the fruits and entitlements of having a CCL bid and it’s obvious their desire to keep/acquire it back. The allocation money that comes with that bid a game changer and is the difference between rebuilding your roster and keeping valuable pieces long term without having to use a DP tag on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/should-we-judge-the-eastern-and-western-conferences-as-indepdent-leagues-within-mls/#198&quot; title=&quot;2014-01-07 10:18:06&quot;&gt;Eric&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not sure you can really say that the emphasis is on winning the conference RATHER THAN the supporters shield, because teams are essentially fighting for both with the same objective. Get the most points possible. It’s not like college conferences where you can win your conference despite being terrible out of conference. If an MLS team sucks against the opposite conference, it impacts their standing in their own conference, if a college football team goes 0-4 in non-conference and 8-0 in conference, they win their conference. Conference games are more important only because teams play more of them due to the unbalanced schedule. I’m not sure that the CCL qualification really provides an extra incentive for teams, since most teams in conference championship race are also in SS race and fighting for home field advantage in playoffs/Final.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ASA Podcast XXXIV: The one where we talk 2013 Defenses: Eastern Conference</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so today we start our review of 2013 and look back at Eastern Conference defenses. We call Chicago, DC and Toronto terrible; I name New England the best defensive team—-alongside Sporting Kansas City—-and then add Columbus Crew as a dark horse for potential lowest goal against tally in 2014. We were privileged to have with us Bill Vegas, aka &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/letskillrobots&quot;&gt;@letskillrobots&lt;/a&gt;,on the podcast tonight so please go out and give him a follow and check out his work over at ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://everybodysoccer.com/&quot;&gt;Everybody Soccer&lt;/a&gt;‘. We sadly didn’t get to talk about his children’s soccer book review, Five Iron Frenzy, their amazing trumpet player Leanor Ortega aka Jeff the Girl, or Andrew Schaub…maybe we need a not American Soccer Analysis podcast where we talk about the other things outside the soccer pitch that connect us as fans. If so, I’m pretty sure he’d be one of the best guests for me to talk to. Anyway, there were some moments in which Drew and I both messed up during today’s podcast, and here follow the obligatory corrections. A) I said that this is podcast 33… that’s wrong. 33 was last year, this is Season 2, Episode 1 or 34… I’m not sure which I’m going to call it yet. Taking notes and general opinions. B) Drew stated that Chad Marshall was traded for Steve Clark. That’s not true, but it was all really close together, and considering that Seattle really got nothing for Clarke—-kind of like Columbus gave nothing up for Marshall—-it kind of is the same thing. C) I said it was Ted Knuterson that ran StatBombs. It is Ted Knutson. I’m a goober. D) I made 14 other mistakes… if you can find them all and list each one in the comments, you can have a $1 gift card to Amazon.com. REALLY!

      <title>Positions and The Diminishing Value of Formations</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/positions-and-the-diminishing-value-of-formations/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/positions-and-the-diminishing-value-of-formations/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s Christmas Eve, so what better time to highlight an article by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/dec/18/question-holding-midfielders-changing-role&quot;&gt;Jonathan Wilson of the UK Guardian&lt;/a&gt; which talks a little about formations and the future of positions in soccer?! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As positions become more specialised, as we divide the holder into destroyer, regista and carrier, and all points in between, so the importance of formations has diminished. Terms like 4-4-2 or 4-2-3-1 are useful as a rough guide, but only that: the higher the level, the more teams are agglomerations of bundles of attributes; the key is balance rather than fitting to some abstract designation, even if that shape can be useful in the defensive phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something that Drew, Matthias and I have mentioned on past podcasts and something that I believe is a true within the “modern era” of soccer. Players are increasingly versatile, and as such are able to handle more duties on the pitch, as well as the fact that it’s being more expected of them. The reality is that we see players put into areas of the pitch based on what they are able to do and what makes them unique to the roster. Wilson speaks of position rather than an interpretation of what I assume is a role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parreira’s 4-6 vision of the future has been overtaken by a 3-7, either as three centre-backs or two centre-backs with a destroyer just in front of them. That is another discussion, but what is true is that to speak of a holding role is merely to describe a player’s position on the pitch and not how he interprets it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilson here is speaking of Brazilian national team coach Carlos Alberto Parreira and his prediction that soccer would migrate to more ambiguous roles. Also this article was speaking specifically to the roles of midfielders, but I think we can safely apply his words to the attack as a whole. There is a possibility we may be seeing something of this prophecy come about in Major League Soccer in 2014. Teams such as Portland, Chicago, Columbus, New England, and even Seattle with some of it’s recent moves, have the pieces to move towards a 4-6 where they have a lesser-defined striker, or “false nine,” at the top of their formation. These teams’ capable scorers like &lt;strong&gt;Darlington Nagbe&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Mike Magee&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Federico Hinguian&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Diego Fagundez&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clint Dempsey&lt;/strong&gt; aren’t relegated to striker positions by convention, where they probably wouldn’t play best anyway. This isn’t to say that strikers or players of those specific roles and old time “mentality” is absolutely wrong or trash now. No, I think this is something that you incorporate. As Wilson said in his post, “it’s about balance,” and it’s about putting together a group of players that are able to A) create good shots on the opponent’s goal and B) defend and attempt to prevent shots against its own goal. This goes further into building a roster and down through a rabbit hole of discussion which I’m sure that we could have any time, and which would eventually eclipse my knowledge base. That said, I think this is real. I don’t think this is a fad but something that will be realized as a changing of the guard and a new way of thinking. I’ll excuse myself as I mutter something about idealism, while trying not to have the door hit me in the hindquarters as I woke out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Build a Roster: Chad Marshall vs. Bobby Boswell</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/how-to-build-a-roster-chad-marshall-vs-bobby-boswell/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A topic that I’ve been exploring this off-season for myself is how to go about building a successful roster in MLS given all the various mechanism that are involved and a salary cap to work around. It’s not just how to build a successful roster, but how you would go about building one with sustainable success—-a task that many clubs find an incredibly difficult given the methodology of the league. The question I ask aloud is whether or not it’s a problem of being stubborn and trying to go about acquiring talent the way most in the world do, or using the system in place. This may or may not be a series that takes place over the course of the off-season. But last week there were a couple of transactions that occurred that struck my fancy in terms of how each front office went about it. Obviously there are factors that you have to consider, such as table placement, which in turn dictates allocation money and a various assortment of other little details. I think, overall, finding and acquiring defensive talent is a really tough task and I’m not entirely certain that you can go about trying to build for multiple years all in one off-season. Committing too much money to a single player can complicate roster moves for mid-season acquisitions, but can be easily cleared up in a single off-season with the help of the re-entry draft, various trades and the SuperDraft. The re-entry draft is a basic way to spread some of the talent across the league when clubs aren’t able to incorporate the players price tag under their cap. The draft—-if you aren’t familiar—-functions in two different stages, with teams selecting players working in reverse order of the seasons table. Stage 1: players selected have to either have their options exercised, or teams are required to offer. Stage 2: a team can offer the player basically a “genuine offer” meaning that there is potential that you can get the player a discount rate. Should a player not sign with team, the club holds the player’s league rights. Over the last week we saw what a team with allocation money can do in the re-entry draft. D.C. United acquired a hand full of players to upgrade their roster situation. One specific player of note is Bobby Boswell, a former MLS Defender of the Year, selected in the second round of the first stage. This means that D.C. United will offer a contract to Boswell that equates to 105% of his salary from the previous season and likely will be in the range of $235,000. Likewise the Seattle Sounders were also looking to upgrade their defensive options. They worked out a trade with the Columbus Crew to acquire another former MLS Defender of the Year, this time in the form of Chad Marshall. The Sounders surrendered allocation money and a 1st round draft pick to the 2015 SuperDraft. We can’t be certain how much allocation money was exchanged between the two teams but my understanding is that it’s somewhere around $75,000. Both players despite being in their late 20’s are solid individuals that will help their new clubs in a specific manner. Looking at the numbers, Seattle was one of the worst defensive teams that made the playoffs with a 0.95 shot attempt ratio that indicates they allow more shots against their goal than they produce for themselves.  D.C. United was just simply abysmal on all fronts, and that fact needs no objective proof. They just sucked. You know it, I know it, and everyone knows it. &lt;strong&gt;Chad Marshall&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Bobby Boswell&lt;/strong&gt; both finished in the top-10 of defensive actions ranking 3rd and 7th overall. This doesn’t necessarily imply any value, as I’ve yet to find any studies that can correlate blocked shots with goals saved, though I think it would be an interesting study. That said, any time you can spend money to potentially reduce the amount of shots your team faces is a good thing. Either way Marshall and Boswell are very similar players in age, style and tactics. But they were acquired by different methods as the Sounders basically spent $125,000 in controlled assets to obtain his rights. DC spent and extra 5% on top of Boswells previous salary to pluck him from the Houston Dynamo and the re-entry draft. Boswell will cost United roughly $235,000 in total numbers to put him on their squad. Assuming Marshall doesn’t negotiate his contract any further down, he’ll cost the Sounders $485,000 in both salary AND the assets they spent to acquire him. I think it’s funny how many people criticized the United’s front office in their move to select Boswell in the first stage, but the truth is they got a better value for the same piece as the Sounders giving up only half the assets. It’s easy to make fun of those that are already calling D.C. United “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rantsports.com/soccer/2013/12/20/dc-united-early-favorite-to-win-2014-mls-cup/&quot;&gt;an early favorite&lt;/a&gt;“ for the MLS Cup. It’s impossible to know if any of these changes really help either Seattle or DC.  Admittedly it’s hard to not see the Red and Black improve from where they were last year, and adding the handful of upgrades across their roster and full season of a healthy Chris Pontius should help—-at the very least making their starting XI that much more handsome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/how-to-build-a-roster-chad-marshall-vs-bobby-boswell/#187&quot; title=&quot;2013-12-26 01:08:05&quot;&gt;Cris Pannullo&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it’s also important to make a distinction as to what each club is trying to accomplish with these respective pick-ups. DC United was a pile of human garbage last year. All of their off-season moves are basically just trying to solve the question, “How can we make this team respectable next season?” Boswell definitely fits the bill as a prototypical MLS-style center-back: big, good in the air, and a sub-par passer. He will be an immediate upgrade over Daniel Woolard, Ethan White (for now), and an out-of-position Perry Kitchen. But they aren’t looking to him to win the east. They just want to churn out a product that won’t be an embarrassment to their fans. If they get 3 years out of Boswell as a solid transition player at $235,000 while Ethan White develops, that would be a win for them. Seattle has a top-tier roster as far as MLS goes, and what cost them any chance at a trophy last season was their slapdash defense, particularly their center-back pairing. In picking up Marshall, Seattle is rolling the dice, splashing some bucks on a top-tier center-back and hoping he can stay healthy and in form, and help them to a cup or a shield. Seattle is willing to risk to extra cash because the end goal for them is the top of the league. Though Marshall won’t be worth as many total wins as Boswell will be for DC (how could he be?), the additional wins he provides over Hurtado/Traore will be more valuable than Boswell’s, as each additional point/win brings them incrementally closer to a shield (and additional home-field advantages for the playoffs). I wish there were a way—and maybe there is—to quantify how much more important each additional win/point is. But then you would have to quantify the importance of the Supporters Shield and MLS Cup (along with the US Open Cup and Canadian Championship), which is especially tricky given that the end goal of a professional sports franchise isn’t just to win, but also to remain profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/how-to-build-a-roster-chad-marshall-vs-bobby-boswell/#188&quot; title=&quot;2013-12-26 21:41:48&quot;&gt;Harrison Crow&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, there are multiple themes to wade through and there is a lot of stuff that we can’t comment on as much as we would like but with Marshall Seattle is willing to pay that extra cost as in the “the marginal dollar value of a win” with personnel. As you state, while it costs Seattle more to have Marshall and his upgrade over Hurtado is less than Boswell over Daniel Woolard or Dejan Jakovic it means more to them. The problem that I have with this is that the talent gap inthe league is so slim. DC has gone from worst team in the league to legit playoff contender in the lesser of the two conferences. Once DC gets into the playoffs, it’s possible that their probability to get to the MLS Cup from the Eastern Conference is near if not on par with Seattle. It’d be one thing if you were attempting to build a club and push them from being an 88 Win team to a legit 92+ win team for the division in baseball. But the fact is that parity in this league is so much tighter and because of that teams can rebuild into significantly capable clubs in one off-season. Getting back to the issue, Seattle could have had Boswell, who would have also been an upgrade to both Hurtado and Traore, and for a lesser amount than what they parted to get Marshall. The one thing they got with Marshall above all else is his name and the associated belief of how good he is how he’s perceived around the league. I’d argue that they could have easily gone with Boswell and it would have satisfied the same need.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sporting adds Gruenebaum to twiddle thumbs</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/sporting-signs-gruenebaum-to-twiddle-thumbs/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After Jimmy Nielsen retired on a high note, Sporting Kansas City wasted little time trading for Columbus’ starting No. 1, Andy Gruenebaum. SKC &lt;a href=&quot;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/20131216/crew-gruenebaum-clark-sounders-trade.ap/&quot;&gt;gave up a second-round draft pick&lt;/a&gt; to acquire Gruenebaum. Though a second-round pick in MLS is probably not as valuable as it is in, say, the NFL, Sporting has now essentially spent a draft pick on a &lt;strong&gt;backup&lt;/strong&gt; goalkeeper because Vermes&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/12/21/sporting-kc-manager-names-eric-kronberg-clubs-no-1-goalkeeper-after-signing-&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/12/21/sporting-kc-manager-names-eric-kronberg-clubs-no-1-goalkeeper-after-signing-&quot;&gt;named&lt;/a&gt; Eric Kronberg the starter for 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The last two years, [Kronberg’s] been more than ready to try to assume the position,” Vermes said. “The difference is that Jimmy’s been on top of his game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I haven’t seen Kronberg play at all because, well, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mlssoccer.com/players/eric-kronberg&quot;&gt;who has&lt;/a&gt;? He’s only played 382 minutes over eight seasons—-about the equivalent of four full starts. But Vermes’ decision still perplexes me. For instance, Kronberg has played behind Nielsen for some time, and based on 2013 data, Nielsen was not a very good goalkeeper. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AttujdNBdATWdGh0a1V0QWp6ZHlLcDlJYmlyd1oxQkE&amp;amp;output=html&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; from our own Will Reno and &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/shot-locations/goalkeeper-ratings/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; from our shot locations data both suggest that Nielsen was basically “replacement level” this past season. Kronberg is not likely to be much better, if at all, since he was playing behind Nielsen. Then there’s Gruenebaum. I talked about him on &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/12/20/asa-podcast-xxxiii-the-one-where-we-talk-re-entry-draft/&quot;&gt;the podcast&lt;/a&gt; last week, but here’s the short of it. That same data up there suggests Gruenebaum was one of the better goalkeepers in MLS last season. Both Will and I independently arrived at our statistical ratings, and Will ranked Gruenebaum as the second-best keeper on a per-game basis, while I ranked him as the third-best in the league (among regular starters, by “Goal Ratio”). Nielsen was something like 16th. Kronberg watched Nielsen from the bench. Obviously, I haven’t been watching Kronberg train as I am not Peter Vermes. But two independent sets of keeper ratings make Gruenebaum sound like a top shelf No. 1, making this a puzzling decision from my, admittedly limited, perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Does last season matter? - Follow Up</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/11/23/does-last-season-matter/&quot;&gt;a few weeks ago&lt;/a&gt; about the weak predictive information contained in a team’s previous season of data. When trying to predict a team’s goal differential in the &lt;strong&gt;second&lt;/strong&gt; 17 games of a season, it was the &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; 17 games of that same season that did the job. The previous season’s data was largely unhelpful. @sea_soc tweeted me the following: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sea_soc/status/406507942179905537&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/sea_soc/status/406507942179905537&lt;/a&gt; Ask, and you shall receive. Here’s the weird shit I found when trying to project a seasons &lt;strong&gt;second-half&lt;/strong&gt; goal differential: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stat&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Coef.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;P-Value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intercept
-33.6
0.86%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AttemptDiff (first 17)
0.1
0.00%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finish Diff (first 17)
90.6
0.12%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attempt Diff (first 17 last season)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.88%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempt Diff (second 17 last season
0.0
20.00%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finish Diff (first 17 last season)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;115.0&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;7.08%&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finish Diff (second 17 last season)
-23.5
28.81%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home Games Left
4.0
0.81%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation: Strangely, it’s the &lt;strong&gt;first part&lt;/strong&gt; of the previous season that is the better predictor of future performance. Not the second part of last season, which actually happened more recently. In fact, information from the second part of each team’s previous season produced negative coefficients (negative relationships). Weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s change the response variable slightly to be a team’s goal differential from its &lt;strong&gt;first 17 games&lt;/strong&gt;. Which does better at predicting, last season’s first half or last season’s second half?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither. In fact, there was nothing that came close to predicting the first halves of 2012 and 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stat&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Coef.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;P-value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intercept
18.9
20.3%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finish Diff (first 17 last season)
-5.5
94.5%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finish Diff (second 17 last season)

60.9%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempt Diff (first 17 last season)
0.01

&lt;p&gt;Attempt Diff (second 17 last season)
0.04
32.5%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home Games (first 17 this season)
-2.2
20.3%
With such small sample sizes, it could be there is just something really weird about the first halves, especially 2013. I say “especially 2013” because 2011 and 2012’s first halves seemed to do a fair job of projecting the next season’s second halves, so it’s 2013 that seems screwy. Portland and Seattle performed opposite of what would have been expected for each, for example, while D.C. United and Montreal did the same confusing switcheroo in the Eastern Conference to kick off the 2013 campaign. So it could have just been weird randomness. In the end, I’m quite certain of one thing, and that’s that I’m still confused.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, I want to pre-apologize for you having to tolerate terrible audio on the podcast. We’ve generally had good quality with just a few quirks in the system. This time around my microphone had an issue, and we couldn’t figure it out with the limited time that we had to record. Second, because we had limited time to record the podcast feels a bit rushed, and I’m sorry for that. I really wanted to get something together since it’d been a couple weeks since we last recorded, and I felt there were some good topics for us to touch on. Today, we talk Portland, DC United, Seattle, while touching a bit on the Columbus and Sporting KC keeper trades. We roll into the SKC-versus-RSL MLS Cup and just give a few spare thoughts. It’s only 30 minutes and I think, despite the short time, we stay on topic and hit a lot of good highlights. We’ll be back after the start of the new year and we’ll have our act together then. I still think today’s has some pretty good stuff, though!

      <title>MLS Cup Thoughts and General Goalkeeper Roundup</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three things in this post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. MLS final 2. Goalkeeper of the Year Award 3. MLS Goalkeeper Final Destination&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. MLS final &lt;/strong&gt; [youtube=&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SJq24zFwoQ&amp;amp;w=560&amp;amp;h=315&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SJq24zFwoQ&amp;amp;w=560&amp;amp;h=315&lt;/a&gt;] We were all made aware of the conditions before the game. The ice on the field, the cold temperatures, the effects on the ball… but then again, it’s the final in your sport so maybe it’s not the best time to come up with excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final featured &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/mls-cup-thoughts-and-general-goal-keeper-roundup/www.pamplinmedia.com/pt/12-sports/203265-mls-awards-go-to-ricketts-valeri-&quot;&gt;two of the three finalists&lt;/a&gt; for Goalkeeper of the Year so we should expect an exciting display between both set of posts. This was not the case. Let’s walk through the video &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0:58&lt;/strong&gt; - Nick Rimando makes a half-falling/half-diving save in the twenty-fifth minute. It’s enough in his mitts that he can hold it, but he pushes it wide and almost bonks his head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:28&lt;/strong&gt; - Nielsen gets a little too far under a punch and sends it straight up in the air, almost setting up a gift of a goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:20&lt;/strong&gt; - If you notice, this is the third highlight and we’re almost through the first half. That might tell you something. Rimando stays alert, and the bouncing ball isn’t in complete control of Dwyer. It’s a needed save but not that tough. Rimando has time to get there and Dwyer has a limited shooting angle on goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:40&lt;/strong&gt; - Start of the second half sees CJ Sapong with the ball in front of goal yet again. Rimando gets caught going the wrong way when Sapong cuts off the cross. He tries to scramble to the post but luckily (for Rimando) the shot skies over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:25&lt;/strong&gt; - RSL gets the first goal of the game from a nice no-look-pass from Beckerman to Sabario who chests then volleys it home. But check out Nielsen’s starting position on the shot. &lt;img src=&quot;http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-12-30-50-pm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 12.30.50 PM&quot;&gt; So far from the line! He could have chipped him if he tried (foreshadowing, wooOOoo!). Sabario takes the trap and Nielsen (who starts calling for a handball) is so far from the line he can’t get into position well enough (notice the green triangles below). If he’s closer to the line he can get into position better and he’ll have more time to react, likely making the save.
[caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”490”]&lt;img src=&quot;http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-12-26-32-pm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 12.26.32 PM&quot;&gt; Handball![/caption] [caption id=”attachment_909” align=”aligncenter” width=”490”]&lt;img src=&quot;http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-12-26-38-pm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 12.26.38 PM&quot;&gt; Shooting angles[/caption] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:50&lt;/strong&gt; - Beckerman takes a shot from distance. On the replay (5:12), check out Nielsen’s left foot: cemented into the ground. His right foot does all the moving. This is not good. Just turning your body to make a save really limits the distance you can cover. A quicker shuffle to Nielsen’s left can get a hand on that shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:25&lt;/strong&gt; - Possibly the biggest “LOL” of the match. Nielsen is so far off his line that the most casual chip almost beats him. The ball doesn’t even clear the crossbar, if that tells you how non-chalant the chip was. &lt;img src=&quot;http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-12-59-41-pm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 12.59.41 PM&quot;&gt; Nielsen turns around, surprised the ball is still in play, chases it out and eats snow hard. Woof.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6:40&lt;/strong&gt; - SKC equalizes with a questionably fair header…Rimando bounces over but can’t make the extension. [caption id=”attachment&lt;em&gt;912” align=”aligncenter” width=”490”]&lt;img src=&quot;http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-1-03-38-pm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 1.03.38 PM&quot;&gt; _If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.&lt;/em&gt;[/caption]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:20&lt;/strong&gt; - Ninety-third minute and Rimando makes the “Allstate Good Hands Save of the Match”. A simple tip over from a blast eight yards out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:50&lt;/strong&gt; - Sapong with another chance while being mauled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:25&lt;/strong&gt; - I’ll just leave this picture to sum up the events here:&lt;img src=&quot;http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-2-44-10-am.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 2.44.10 AM&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently nothing happened for the next fifteen minutes and the penalties ensue. Here are the tendancies for Nielsen and Rimando:&lt;img src=&quot;http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-1-19-58-pm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 1.19.58 PM&quot;&gt; The “n’s” and “y’s” are if the keepers guessed the correct way or not. A “y” means yes he did, obviously, and the asterisks mean that while he guessed correctly the ball missed the goal frame. The green represents all the times the shooter did not score (after five rounds it was 3-3, three reds each). Both goalkeepers guessed the right way four of the ten times. The last two columns are where the keepers were guessing. Rimando was 5-2-3 (left-middle-right) and Nielsen was 6-0-4. So if you needed any more proof that shootouts are more determined by the shooters than goalkeeper then… well I don’t know. This games looks pretty clear to me. Nielsen is painted as the shootout hero but almost has the exact same stats as Rimando, not to mention all his follies from the run of play. Also he’s about five feet off his line on the eighth-round shot. (I know the ball is well-past kicked at this point, but he was in the process of planting his foot so it was blurry. Also balls kicked travel faster than feet move.)&lt;img src=&quot;http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-2-34-30-am.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 2.34.30 AM&quot;&gt;
At least it was a fun game. We can all agree on that. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Nielsen could have gotten another foot or two closer to the near post! “…current goalkeeping stats are too simple and don’t gauge anything of real value.” Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>World Cup Draws: United States, Mexico, and the Netherlands</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of those three teams, it’s the United States’s draw that incites the least of my frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search for “world cup draw” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=world+cup+draw&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS382US382&amp;amp;oq=world+cup+draw&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60l3.2402j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;espv=210&amp;amp;es_sm=93&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;on Google&lt;/a&gt;, and you’ll find mostly opinions that the U.S. Mens National Team found itself in &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; group of death, as if there can only be one. But as many pointed out before the draw, the USMNT was not likely to get into an easier group. Coming from Pot 3, the USMNT was at a disadvantage already due to being in the weakest pot. Using ratings from Nate Silver’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/soccer/worldcup/news/_/id/4447078/GuideToSPI&quot;&gt;Soccer Power Index&lt;/a&gt; (SPI), here are the average ratings by each of the four pots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pot&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rating&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Standard Dev.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1
85.9
5.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4
79.7
3.3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2
76.2
8.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;73.7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since teams from the same pot could not meet in the group stage, the USMNT couldn’t draw any teams from its own pot. Thus it automatically got zero chance at playing some of the weaker teams in the opening round, leaving us praying for one of Switzerland or Belgium from the ranked Pot 1 to ease our path to glory (no such luck).  Additionally, all Pot 3 teams got a slightly higher chance of meeting two European teams in the group stages due to &lt;a href=&quot;http://espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/1636989/fifa-confirms-pots-world-cup-draw?cc=5901&quot;&gt;that additional UEFA team moving&lt;/a&gt; from Pot 4 to Pot 2. Pot 3 teams eluding a European team from Pot 1 may still have gotten Italy or England (I can’t tell which one) from Pot 2. Costa Rica drew the short straw on that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at Nate Silver’s  ratings, you’ll notice that most Pot 3 teams got pretty raw deals. Below are the chances that each team advances to the knockout round, as well as the average ratings for the other teams in their respective groups. Pot 3 teams are bold and italicized, and data came from &lt;a href=&quot;http://espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/1641670/all-groups?cc=5901&quot;&gt;Silver’s own model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iran&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;81.2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

79.3
39.5%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina
75.6
97.3%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netherlands
81.3
41.0%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil
73.9
99.6%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative to its stature in the world—-17th best according to the SPI—-the United States drew arguably the second-hardest group of opponents, second only to the Netherlands&lt;em&gt;. Though the USMNT may be in &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; group of death, the Netherlands are definitely in &lt;em&gt;*the&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; group of death—-and on the outside looking in. But it’s our neighbor to the south that draws the most frustration. In terms of average group difficulty, the only North American side to get a relatively decent draw was Mexico. Mexico will just have to be better than Croatia and Cameroon in the group stage. Even after pissing all over themselves in CONCACAF qualifying, the Mexicans now have the easiest path of any Pot 3 team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch side is the ninth-best in the tournament by the SPI, and yet it drew two of the best teams in the Cup, Chile and Spain. The Oranje, the team of my birth country, have been left sadly with just a 41-percent chance at making the knockout stage. The Mexican side is ranked 26th in the world, finished fourth in qualifying, and has a better chance to advance than the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, FIFA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*While Australia, Iran and Costa Rica all drew harder opponents on average than the USMNT, they were not as highly ranked themselves as the USMNT. In other words, it was expected that worse teams would get tougher opponents because they don’t get to play themselves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sporting exceptional at home; RSL lame on the road</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is true that Sporting has had trouble getting points at home. SKC earned 30 points at Sporting Park this year, good for 13th in a league of 19 teams. Based on that information alone, some will argue that Sporting is not a good home team. One of those people is Simon Borg, who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mlssoccer.com/video/2013/12/05/sporting-kc-mls-cup-favorite-over-real-salt-lake-playoff-central&quot;&gt;justifies his viewpoint&lt;/a&gt; by pointing out that SKC lost five times at home, as though that matters. It doesn’t. I’ve shown that &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/08/12/signal-and-noise-in-mls/&quot;&gt;past points simply don’t correlate well to future points&lt;/a&gt;. With information like shot ratios and expected goal differentials (xGD), points are essentially a meaningless indicator of team ability—-or at the very least, a meaningless &lt;strong&gt;predictor&lt;/strong&gt;. I see “predictor” and “indicator” as near-synonyms in this instance, but you may not. Regardless, Sporting’s home points total should not even be considered in the discussion of who will win on Saturday. Why not? In addition to out-shooting its opponents in &lt;strong&gt;every single home game this season&lt;/strong&gt;, here is how SKC did relative to the league in xGD this season: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;GF&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;GA&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;GD&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;xGF&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;xGA&lt;/strong&gt;

SKC has a decent goal differential at home, but more importantly, it has the second-best &lt;strong&gt;expected&lt;/strong&gt; goal differential at home. xGD is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/11/08/the-predictive-power-of-shot-locations-data/&quot;&gt;excellent predictor&lt;/a&gt; of future success, and a better indication in my mind of true team skill. Borg goes on to talk about the “road warriors” from Salt Lake City: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“They love playing on the road. Playing at home is too much pressure; they do it better when they’re away from home.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;__No team is better on the road than at home, but whatever. RSL did tie for third in MLS this season with 22 away points earned, but again, we don’t care. RSL out-shot it opponents in just five of 17 road games (29.4%), and, well this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;GF&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;GA&lt;/strong&gt;

      <title>MLS Cup: Sporting KC vs. Real Salt Lake...Its Finally Here</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wish I could write this long-winded and amazingly-thought-out post. This just won’t be the case. I’m mostly missing the vocabulary to mark the occasion of the biggest match of the American soccer season. Without really prolonging the post or trying to set it up by way of a specific perspective: I was digging around through Squawka and Whoscored data in preparation for tonight’s podcast and found some things that I thought were interesting, and I thought that I would share them with you. &lt;strong&gt;First thought:&lt;/strong&gt; Sporting Kansas City pretty much owns the defensive metric counting stats that are available to us, as well as those that I took the time to put together. They rank first in defensive actions recorded, which is simply blocked shots, interceptions and clearances. There isn’t anything that I’ve seen or read that correlates any of these numbers to being a successful team in terms of collecting points. That being said, it’s reasonable to suspect that their ability to prevent shots and produce them at a higher ratio has something to do with these defensive statistics. I personally would associate SKC’s shot ratios with two specific abilities : their possession—-which we will get in first—-and then prevention. Possession doesn’t tell us whether or not a club is successful, but we have mentioned that it mostly just explains how they going about being successful. Sure, a lot of people take it that when a team is holding onto the ball, that reduces its own opportunities to score. That doesn’t mean that they aren’t reducing their opponents’ opportunities, though. In fact a club that holds on to the ball and makes a lot of successful passes does exactly that. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean they are good at defense or preventing the opposition from generating shots. It just means that they might potentially reduce the number of chances that an opposing team gets. Again, that doesn’t necessarily correlate to earning points, but that does lead to us to the topic of prevention. Sporting is dominant in MLS with intercepting and clearing balls from their attacking third. Controlling possession 58% of the time at home and completing 81% of their passes, they are mitigating opponents’ opportunities, and the same can be said with clearing balls off the backline and preventing the ball from coming into the attacking third at all. Clearing the ball obviously presents the chance that the open play becomes “reset”. That the pressure applied by the opposing attack has to reposition themselves in an manner that would create another chance against the goal. Sometimes that happens quickly sometimes it leads to a turnover in possession. I’d really like to know the percentage of how many times a team got the ball into the final third and then created a shot. I suspect that Sporting Kansas City isn’t necessarily any better than any other team at actually stopping a team from creating chances once they get into the attacking third. Possibly it just limits those entries. However, if a team isn’t getting many opportunities to possess the ball, and their chances of breaking into the attacking third are repelled by clearances, it has to limit the creation of shots. This is my theory on how Sporting KC has produced that positive shot ratio and why their defensive counting stats matter. I don’t really know if any of it actually holds up. &lt;strong&gt;Second Thought:&lt;/strong&gt; Real Salt Lake is basically the best litmus test for this theory. A club that has superior passing talent, that also maintains the ability to possess the ball, and doesn’t inadvertently turn it over with the frequency that others do. Again, for like the thousandth time, this doesn’t relate to obtaining points. However, it maybe the specific method they go about for shot creation which does lend itself as predictor. Creating shots is the name of the game, and RSL is one of the better road teams in MLS who matches up well with SKC in that regard. If SKC’s deterrence method for shots is more about mitigation of possession to specific areas of the pitch which potentially lends itself to preventing shots, then the counter is that RSL is third in away goals from outside the box with 4 converted shots by way of 74 shots. RSL is one of the better teams at converting from distance—-and while that could be as much by the way of luck as it could be by the talent of the line-ups they’ve fielded—-the importance of this is that they aren’t afraid of taking attempts from distance, and that maybe one of the best ways for them to manage a goal against SKC. That leads into this &lt;strong&gt;final thought&lt;/strong&gt;: Looking at shots, it’s a duh statement to say that SKC creates a lot of them. Unfortunately for Real Salt Lake, Sporting creates even more at home than what it normally creates on the road. What is more surprising, though, is that of those shots, the majority come from outside of the 18 yard box. Why would it matter if a team creates more shots from a far than closer to the box? The obvious answer is that it decreases the probability of a goal scoring opportunity. Taking shots is important, regardless of where it’s taken from. Without the shot there is a lack possibility that the ball actually goes into the back of the net…well, unless you are D.C. United and the rest of the league &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigsoccer.com/community/threads/leading-scorer-own-goal.1994763/&quot;&gt;leads your team&lt;/a&gt; in goals scored. I certainly approve of most shots because they creates chances. A shot that is parried or even deflected back into a crowd is another chance, a better chance, to score a goal. The problem is when you take a shot you are also conceding possession, as well as position in the attacking third. Better position equates to a higher possibility of a scoring chance and ultimately that’s what your trying to do: increase the odds of scoring a goal. Despite taking 164 shots from outside the box &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;at home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Sporting only scored 5 goals, opposed to 29 goals from 105 shots inside the box. Taking shots from better locations is going to improve your odds, but it’s more than that. It’s about finding the opportunity to win games. Saturday will simply be about finding those moments, finishing them and then, hopefully, winning. Both teams have remarkable similarities and they both possess the ability to expose the others weaknesses. This has the potential to be one of the best MLS Cups in recent memory. That isn’t to say that LA and Houston pounding on each other hasn’t been somewhat entertaining. But SKC and RSL bring to the table a style of soccer that is pleasing to watch, and each procures shots—-which is one of the biggest complaints from people who are infrequent viewers. It also will, hopefully, attract some of those individuals who usually are less inclined to watch American soccer, relegating themselves to the European versions. Here is just hoping the game is just interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, guys… we’re back with better audio quality this week. A big thanks to Drew who put things together last week in my place, and despite technology failing apart around them, Drew and Matty were able to put together a great podcast. This week on the show we tackle MLS playoffs, CONCACAF and USMNT dealings and then some Transfers/Loan rumors that are out there. It’s a longer podcast, but it’d been a few weeks since we all got together, and things just rolled. I hope you enjoy it.

      <title>MVP Discussion: Soccer shares baseballs issues</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/major-league-mvps/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the wake of Major League Baseball awarding its MVP to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cabremi01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;amp;utm_source=direct&amp;amp;utm_medium=linker-americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Miguel Cabrera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, debates over what “valuable” means have once again flared up. Though soccer and baseball are two incredibly different sports, I think we can apply some of the same logic to both MVP discussions. Major League Soccer has about two weeks remaining before its MVP award is handed out, and we will no doubt encounter many of the same controversies in the soccer blogosphere that appear in baseball every season. The MVP controversy usually begins with what “valuable” means. I think there’s little doubt in most people’s minds that “valuable” and “skilled” are correlated. The main controversy is &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; correlated. To some, asking who was the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; player in Major League Soccer in 2013 would be equivalent to asking who was the &lt;em&gt;most valuable&lt;/em&gt; to his team. &lt;strong&gt;To others, there would be some key distinctions, the most common of which is that MVPs must come from teams that reach the post season.&lt;/strong&gt; In retort to that thinking, some very astute commenters in a Fangraphs.com forum offered up these nuggets. Hendu for Kutch &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/trout-and-cabrera-here-we-go-again/&quot;&gt;made the analogy&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We each want to buy something that costs $1. I’ve got a quarter, 8 nickels, and 10 pennies. My ‘team’ of coins is worth 75 cents and falls short of being able to buy the item. You have one dime and 18 nickels. Your ‘team’ is worth $1, and you successfully buy the item. Is your dime more valuable than my quarter simply because it led to a successful item purchase?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/t/troutmi01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;amp;utm_source=direct&amp;amp;utm_medium=linker-americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Mike Trout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; = quarter and Miguel Cabrera = dime, for those of you not so into baseball, and the question is a good one. Few would argue that the dime is more valuable than the quarter just because it found itself in a position to help buy that scrumptious Twix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reply to someone arguing that the quarter had no value because it didn’t lead to the purchase of a desired item, BIP and ndavis910 then chimed in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Except not everything costs $1, and at any rate, you would always choose the quarter over the dime when accumulating money for a purchase.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Especially when you don’t know the cost of the items until you get to the store. In baseball, a team cannot be sure how many wins it will take to reach the playoffs until the last day of the season. In your example, the quarter is the most valuable piece regardless of whether or not the item cost $1 or $0.75.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When thinking about attributing value to players like Marco Di Vaio, Mike Magee, Camilo Sanvezzo, Robbie Keane and company, why should it matter where their teams finished? If one believes that Magee, for instance, is the best player in MLS, then does it matter if he took his team from 39 points to 49, versus from 40 points to 50? Either way, it’s still ten points of value in the standings. When Magee was traded to Chicago, neither Chicago nor Magee knew that the Fire was going to need 50 points to make the playoffs. The fact that they got just 49 points shouldn’t negate any of Magee’s value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you say that it matters because MLS clubs get real value from extra playoff games, then think about this. Playoff cutoff lines are quite arbitrary. If MLS allowed only the top two teams in from each conference—-not completely unreasonable for a league of just 19 teams—-then none of the players mentioned above would be considered under this playoffs requirement. Playoffs represent an arbitrary bar that the players competing for the award don’t get to set, and while reaching the playoffs does bring the team measurable revenue and value, basing an award on something outside an individual’s control would, in my opinion, strip the award of its intended meaning and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s anticipate the logical counterargument—-that players pick up their games in playoff races and play well when it matters most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a moment, let’s ignore the fact that little evidence has ever been found in professional sports that players can turn it on and turn it off as needed. This past season, Magee scored seven goals in Chicago’s final nine games, a stretch in which the team averaged 1.56 points per match. That represents a pace that would have gotten the Fire into the playoffs if maintained for the entire season. Di Vaio scored five goals in his last 10 games—-I even included that tenth-to-last game in which he scored two goals—-in a stretch where Montreal tallied just 0.7 points per match, limping into the playoffs on a tie-breaker with Chicago. Just because one team makes the playoffs doesn’t mean its best player was at his peak when it mattered. Goals are, admittedly, a narrow-minded way to measure a striker’s value, but I think the point is still valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the Magee-Di Vaio example above may have been no more than an exercise in confirmation bias. I chose to see what I already believed. However, the logic behind the belief that team standings shouldn’t matter to players’ MVP merits is still good stuff, and transcends any biased example I can come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we’re ready to agree that that the MVP award should essentially be given to the best overall player, then we still have a tall task ahead of us. How do we measure skill on the soccer field? That is the 64,000-dollar question, and one &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/projects/field-player-value/&quot;&gt;we hope to help tackle&lt;/a&gt; here at ASA some day. But perhaps it’s not so crazy to think that a guy like Federico Higuain &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/11/05/a-closer-look-at-the-mls-mvp-race/&quot;&gt;is deserving of the MVP award&lt;/a&gt;. If you scoff at that notion, you likely do so because you’ve been trained to think about MVP awards in a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re all about re-thinking things around here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/major-league-mvps/#153&quot; title=&quot;2013-11-18 17:53:12&quot;&gt;Cris Pannullo&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; One problem with comparing soccer with baseball is that baseball is, for all intents and purposes, an individual game. Soccer, on the other hand, is a sport in which the actions of one player are almost entirely dependent upon their teammates and tactics. Higuain may be worth a quarter in Columbus, where he is the only creative threat and has carte blanche to roam about the attacking half of the field, but would he be worth nearly as much on a team like Los Angeles, who employ their central midfielders as ballhawks, enabling Keane, Donovan, and Zardes to counterattack at will? His inclusion in a Galaxy lineup would force a complete reconfiguration of their system (short of perhaps shifting Donovan to right mid), and could potentially result in a weakened Galaxy side. Higuain may be worth a quarter in Columbus Dollars, but other MLS cities employ entirely different currencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/major-league-mvps/#154&quot; title=&quot;2013-11-18 19:50:10&quot;&gt;Matthias Kullowatz (@MattyAnselmo)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s a fair point. I think my wording could be slightly bent to include that point. If, theoretically, Higuain were worth 11 points to Columbus (but not necessarily 11 to Montreal, for instance) and Di Vaio were worth 10 to Montreal (but not necessarily to Columbus, for instance), then we could say that Higuain was worth more than Di Vaio, conditional on them playing for their respective teams. Should it matter that Montreal made the playoffs? I think not, but I see how the coin analogy may not fit quite as well in soccer as in baseball.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Thanksgiving, all! We have a Conference Finals-centric podcast concerning the outcomes this past weekend’s matches. Also, there was a little discussion that came out of it concerning formations vs. personnel. It’s just us talking and coming up some random thoughts. It’s not that long, but it’s us and we’re having a good chat… I think Matty at one point insults &lt;strong&gt;Sebastián Velásquez&lt;/strong&gt;‘s hair cut, so there is that.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week we talked about how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/the-festrunk-brothers/n8662/&quot;&gt;cool and hip&lt;/a&gt; we are, followed by a discussion of the first legs of the MLS Cup semifinals. We continued with potential changes to MLS’ CONCACAF Champions League births, Klinsmann’s 23 man roster for the upcoming friendlies versus Scotland and Austria, and the top 50 players in MLS by pass completion percentage. We concluded with a discussion of burritos and proper burrito folding practices.

      <title>Does last season matter?</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/does-last-season-matter/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve shown time and time again how helpful a team’s shot rates are in projecting how well that team is likely to do going forward. To this point, however, data has always been contained in-season, ignoring what teams did in past seasons. Since most teams keep large percentages of their personnel, it’s worth looking into the predictive power of last season. We don’t currently have shot locations for previous seasons, but we do have general shot data going back to 2011. This means that I can look at all the 2012 and 2013 teams, and how important their 2011 and 2012 seasons were, respectively. Here goes. First, I split each of the 2012 and 2013 seasons into two halves, calculating stats from each half. Let’s start by leaving out the previous season’s data. Here is the predictive power of shot rates and finishing rates, where &lt;strong&gt;the response variable is second-half goal differential&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stat&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Coefficient&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;P-value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intercept
-28.36792
0.04%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempt Diff (first 17)
0.14244
0.00%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finishing Diff (first 17)
77.06047
1.18%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home Remaining
3.37472
0.03%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, I used total shot attempt differential and finishing rate differential from the first 17 games to predict the goal differential for each team in the final 17 games. Also, I controlled for how many home games each team had remaining. The sample size here is the 56 team-seasons from 2011 through 2013. All three variables are significant in the model, though the individual slopes should be interpreted carefully.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The residual standard error for this model is high at 6.4 goals of differential. Soccer is random, and predicting exact goal differentials is impossible, but that doesn’t mean this regression is worthless. The R-squared value is 0.574, though as &lt;a href=&quot;http://jameswgrayson.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;James Grayson&lt;/a&gt; has pointed out to me, the square root of that figure (0.757) makes more intuitive sense. One might say that we are capable of explaining 57.4 percent of the variance in second-half goal differentials, or 75.7 percent of the standard deviation (sort of). Either way, we’re explaining &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, and that’s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we’re here to talk about the effects of last season, so without further mumbo jumbo, the results of a more-involved linear regression:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stat&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Coefficient&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;P-value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intercept
-31.3994
1.59%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempt Diff (first 17)
0.12426
0.03%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attempt Diff (last season)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.02144&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28.03%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finishing Diff (first 17)
93.27359
1.14%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finishing Diff (last season)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;72.69412&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.09%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home Remaining
3.71992
1.53%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’ve added teams’ shot and finishing differentials from the previous season. Obviously, I had to cut out the 2011 data (since 2010 is not available to me currently), as well as Montreal’s 2012 season (since they made no Impact in 2011&lt;strong&gt;). This left me with a sample size of 37 teams. Though the residual standard error was a little higher at 6.6 goals, the regression now explained 65.2 percent of the variance in second-half goal differential. Larger sample sizes would be nice, and I’ll work on that, but for now it seems that—-even halfway through a season—-the previous season’s data &lt;/strong&gt;may** improve the projection, especially when it comes to finishing rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what about projecting outcomes for, say, a team’s fourth game of the season?&lt;/strong&gt; Using its rates from just three games of the current season would lead to shaky projections at best. I theorize that, as a season progresses, the current season’s data get more and more important for the prediction, while the previous season’s data become relatively less important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My results were most assuredly &lt;strong&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt;conclusive, but leaned in a rather strange direction. The previous season’s shot data was seemingly more helpful in predicting outcomes during the &lt;strong&gt;second half of the season&lt;/strong&gt; than it was in the first half—-except, of course, the first few weeks of the season. Specifically, the previous season’s shot data was more helpful for predicting games from weeks 21 to 35 than  it was from weeks 6 to 20. This was true for finishing rates, as well, and led me to recheck my data. The data was errorless, and now I’m left to explain why information from a team’s previous season helps project game outcomes in the second half of the current season better than the first half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anybody want to take a look? Here are the results of some logistic regression models. Note that the coefficients represent the estimated change in (natural) log odds of a home victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Weeks 6 - 20&lt;/strong&gt;

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A look at the 4-2 scoreline may give the appearance that Real Salt Lake shredded Portland’s defense in an wide-open free-for-all. On the contrary, two of RSL’s goals came directly from corner kicks, while a third was courtesy of the generosity and stone touch of Futty Danso (who was also marking Schuler on RSL’s first goal). Credit should of course go to Salt Lake for piling on the pressure, but what really characterized Real Salt Lake’s play on Sunday was not a free-flowing attack, but rather excellent team defense and a commitment to attacking via the flanks. &lt;strong&gt;No Space for Portland&lt;/strong&gt; Throughout the match, Real Salt Lake’s defensive shape remained resolute, and never came close to being broken down by Portland’s 4-3-3. Kyle Beckerman was, as ever, the linchpin of RSL’s midfield, leading the team in aerial duels won with 6 (of 7) and tackles (4, tied with Tony Beltran), and contributing 6 clearances. However, the incessant pressure of Sebastian Velazquez and Luis Gil—who it should be noted are 19 and 22 years old, respectively—along with the fullback pairing of Beltran (who led RSL in touches with 76) and Chris Wingert/Lovel Palmer, never allowed any space for Diego Valeri or Darlington Nagbe to work their magic in the midfield. Many of Portland’s forays into the penalty area stemmed from Rodney Wallace collecting the ball in wide positions and sending in listless crosses (0-for-6) that were easily dealt with by Nat Borchers. Forward Ryan Johnson was kept in check all game, limited to a mere 18 touches in his 59 minutes on the field. The entirety of Portland’s productive offensive output consisted of Will Johnson’s free kick goal, Piquionne’s soaring headed goal, and a 77th minute shot from Alhassan after a slick dribbling spell through the heart of RSL’s midfield. For the entire game, Portland had only two successful dribbles and three successful crosses in the attacking third (one of which was Jewsbury’s beautiful assist). &lt;strong&gt;Defending from the Front&lt;/strong&gt; The only change in the starting lineup for Real Salt Lake to start the game was Devon Sandoval replacing an ailing Alvaro Saborio. While few would argue that Sandoval is the better player, his kinetic style, defensive workrate, and ability to get into wide spaces provided problems for the Great Wall of Gambia. &lt;em&gt;Chalkboards of Devon Sandoval vs. Portland (left) and Alvaro Saborio vs. Los Angeles (right)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/rslvpor-11-11-sandoval.jpg?w=204&quot; alt=&quot;RSLvPor-11-11-Sandoval&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/rslvla-11-07-saborio.jpg?w=203&quot; alt=&quot;RSLvLA-11-07-Saborio&quot;&gt; As you can see, the defense starts from the front. Sandoval pressured wide all game long, trying to disrupt Portland’s rhythm in the defensive half of the field. Of Sandoval’s 43 actions against Portland, only 11 (25.6%) took place in the center third of the field, compared to 15 of 28 (53.6%) for Saborio against Los Angeles. Sandoval also pressured back more than Saborio did: 8 of 43 (18.6%) actions by Sandoval took place in RSL’s half of the field, compared to a meager 2 of 28 for Saborio (7.1%). &lt;strong&gt;Stretching the Diamond&lt;/strong&gt; What really stuck out about the way that Real Salt Lake played, however, was the way that their midfield “diamond” stretched from touchline-to-touchline, with Velazquez manning the left, Gil hugging the right, and Morales drifting from side-to-side, looking for an inch of space wherever he could find it. Here is a chalkboard of passes attempted by Real Salt Lake, along with the percentage of passes attempted from each section of the field: &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/rslvpor-11-11-rslballpossessionareas.jpg?w=203&quot; alt=&quot;RSLvPOR-11-11-RSLBallPossessionAreas&quot;&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/rslvpor-rslpossessionninthed.jpg?w=204&quot; alt=&quot;RSLvPOR-RSLPossessionNinthed&quot;&gt; And here are all of the passes attempted by Portland, along with the percentage breakdown: &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/rslvpor-11-11-porballpossessionareas.jpg?w=204&quot; alt=&quot;RSLvPOR-11-11-PORBallPossessionAreas&quot;&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/rslvpor-porpossessionninthed.jpg?w=204&quot; alt=&quot;RSLvPOR-PORPossessionNinthed&quot;&gt; Real Salt Lake attempted only 13.6% of their passes from the central attacking portions of the field, while 64.3% of their passes came from the wide attacking areas. Portland, by contrast, attempted 18.9% of their passes from the central areas, and 58.6% of their passes coming from the wide attacking zones. RSL ratio of wide-attacking passes to central-attacking passes: 4.73-to-1 POR ratio of wide-attacking passes to central-attacking passes: 3.10-to-1 Real Salt Lake took their chances against Portland’s flank defense rather than try to fight through Will Johnson and Diego Chara. The gambit worked well, as all eight of RSL’s key passes and assists came from wide positions. &lt;strong&gt;Three questions for leg 2 in Portland:&lt;/strong&gt; 1. &lt;em&gt;Will Saborio be healthy?&lt;/em&gt; If so, Sandoval will likely see the bench again as Findley’s speed will serve as an outlet against a high-pressing, possibly desperate Timbers squad, unless… 2. &lt;em&gt;Kreis opts for the 4-2-3-1?&lt;/em&gt; Beckerman and Yordany Alvarez were deployed in a double pivot at Los Angeles a few weeks ago, and while the results were not exactly convincing, it perhaps implies (or at least I’m inferring) that Kreis may want to take a more conservative approach on the road in the playoffs. 3. _Ryan Johnson or Frederic Piquionne? _Ryan Johnson has put in a workmanlike effort thus far in the playoffs, but with his playing time diminishing each game (83 min @ SEA, 69 min v SEA, 59 min @ RSL) and Piquionne finally healthy (and able to leap clear over Nat Borchers), it may be time for Piquionne to crack the starting lineup.&lt;/p&gt;

Good read! I hate starting sentence with “I feel like…”, but I feel like Portland tends to be a central attacking team that works through the middle more so than most other teams. Have you looked at enough data like this to get a sense as to whether or not that’s true? And maybe even whether or not it lends itself to more successful attacking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/game-of-the-week-real-salt-lake-vs-portland-timbers/#139&quot; title=&quot;2013-11-12 14:38:46&quot;&gt;Harrison Crow&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Great piece of work, Cris!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/game-of-the-week-real-salt-lake-vs-portland-timbers/#140&quot; title=&quot;2013-11-12 18:10:42&quot;&gt;Cris Pannullo&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; I would tend to agree with you… with Chara and Johnson staying relatively central and Nagbe often drifting into central positions, it would make sense for Portland to demonstrate some sort of tendency to play central. However, the only team statistic I can find on the subject, from WhoScored, breaks teams down by “Attack Sides” (not sure exactly what that consists of) and Portland ranks 15th in “Middle of the Pitch” with 28%. According to WhoScored they favor the left side, with a commanding 39% (tied for the league lead with NYRB). I would surmise that this is due in large part to the difference in Wallace staying wide vs. Nagbe roaming all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Piquionnes goal means to Portland</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Though our game states data set doesn’t yet include all of 2013, it still includes 137 games. In those 137 games, only five home teams ever went down three goals, and all five teams lost. There were 24 games in which the home team went down two goals, with only one winner (4.2%) and five ties (20.8%). The sample of two-goal games perhaps gives a little hope to the Timbers, but these small sample sizes lend themselves to large margins of error. It is also important to note that teams that go down two goals at home tend to be bad teams—-like Chivas USA, which litters that particular data set. None of the five teams that ever went down three goals at home made the playoffs this year. Only seven of the 24 teams to go down two goals at home made it to the playoffs. Portland is a good team. Depending on your model of preference, the Timbers are somewhere in the top eight. So even if those probabilities up there hypothetically had small margins of error, they still wouldn’t necessarily apply to the Timbers. Oh, and while we’re talking about extra variables, in those games the teams had less time to come back. To work around these confounding variables, I consulted a couple models, and I controlled for team ability using our &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/shot-locations/&quot;&gt;expected goal differential&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s what I found. A logistic model suggests that, for each goal of deficit early in a match, the odds of winning are reduced by a factor of  about two or three. A tie, though, would also allow Portland to play on. A home team’s chances winning &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; tying fall from about 75 percent in a typical game that begins zero-zero, to about 25 percent being down two goals. Down three goals, and that probability plummets to less than 10 percent. But using this particular logistic regression was dangerous, as I was forced to extrapolate for situations that never happen during the regular season—-starting a game from behind. So I went to a linear model. The linear model expects Portland to win by about 0.4 goals. 15.5 percent of home teams in our model were able to perform at least 1.6 goals above expectation, what the Timbers would need to at least force a draw in regulation. Only 4.6 percent of teams performed 2.6 goals above expectation. If we just compromise between what the two models are telling us, then the Timbers probably have about a 20-percent chance to pull off a draw in regulation. That probability would have been closer to five percent had Piquionne not finished a beautiful header in stoppage time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Predictive Power of Shot Locations Data</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/the-predictive-power-of-shot-locations-data/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two articles in particular inspired me this past week—-one by Steve Fenn at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theshinguardian.com/2013/10/31/mls-playoff-ball-who-are-the-belles/&quot;&gt;Shin Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and the other by Mark Taylor at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thepowerofgoals.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/finishing-and-hitting-target-in-mls.html&quot;&gt;The Power of Goals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Steve showed us that, during the 2013 season, the expected goal differentials (xGD) derived from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/shot-locations/&quot;&gt;shot locations data&lt;/a&gt; were better than any other statistics available at predicting outcomes in the second half of the season. It can be argued that statistics that are predictive are also stable, indicating underlying skill rather than luck or randomness. Mark came along and showed that the individual zones themselves behave differently. For example, Mark’s analysis suggested that conversion rates (goal scoring rates) are more skill-driven in zones one, two, and three, but more luck-driven or random in zones four, five, and six. Piecing these fine analyses together, there is reason to believe that a &lt;em&gt;partially&lt;/em&gt; regressed version of xGD may be the most predictive. The xGD currently presented on the site regresses all teams fully back league-average finishing rates. However, one might guess that finishing rates in certain zones may be more skill, and thus predictive. Essentially, we may be losing important information by fully regressing finishing rates to league average within each zone. I assessed the predictive power of finishing rates within each zone by splitting the season into two halves, and then looking at the correlation between finishing rates in each half for each team. The chart is below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Correlation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;P-value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1
0.11
65.6%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2
0.26
28.0%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3
-0.08
74.6%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4
-0.41
8.2%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5
-0.33
17.3%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6
-0.14
58.5%
Wow. This surprised me when I saw it. There are no statistically significant correlations—-especially when the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons#The_problem&quot;&gt;issue of multiple testing&lt;/a&gt; is considered—-and some of the suggested correlations are actually negative. Without more seasons of data (they’re coming, I promise), my best guess is that finishing rates within each zone are pretty much randomly driven in MLS over 17 games. Thus full regression might be the best way to go in the first half of the season. But just in case… I grouped zones one, two, and three into the “close-to-the-goal” group, and zones four, five, and six into the “far-from-the-goal” group. The results: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Correlation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;P-value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close
0.23
34.5%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far
-0.47
4.1%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, well this is interesting. Yes, the multiple testing problem still exists, but let’s assume for a second there actually is a moderate negative correlation for finishing rates in the “far zone.” Maybe the scouting report gets out by mid-season, and defenses close out faster on good shooters from distance? Or something else? Or this is all a type-I error—-I’m still skeptical of that negative correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without doing that whole song and dance for finishing rates &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;against&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, I will say that the results were similar. So full regression on finishing rates for now, more research with more data later!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, piggybacking onto what Mark found, there does seem to be skill-based differences in how many total goals are scored by zone. In other words, some teams are designed to thrive off of a few chances from higher-scoring zones, while others perhaps are more willing to go for quantity over quality. The last thing I want to check is whether or not the expected goal differentials separated by zone contain more predictive information than when lumped together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like some of Mark’s work implied, I found that our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; goal differentials inside the box are very predictive of a team’s actual second-half goal differentials inside the box—-the correlation coefficient was 0.672, better than simple goal differential which registered a correlation of 0.546. This means that perhaps the expected goal differentials from zones one, two, and three should get more weight in a prediction formula. Additionally, having a better goal differential outside the box, specifically in zones five and six, is probably not a good thing. That would just mean that a team is taking too many shots from poor scoring zones. In the end, I went with a model that used &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;attempt difference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; from each zone, and here’s the best model I found.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Coefficient&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;P-value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Intercept)
-0.61
0.98&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zones 1, 3, 4
1.66
0.29&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zone 2
6.35
0.01&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zones 5, 6
-1.11
0.41&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Extremely similar results to using expected goal differential, since xGD within each zone is a linear function of attempts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The R-squared for this model was 0.708, beating out the model that just used overall expected goal differential (0.650). The zone that stabilized fastest was zone two, which makes sense since about a third of all attempts come from zone two. Bigger sample sizes help with stabilization. For those curious, the inputs here were attempt differences &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;per game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; over the first seventeen games, and the response output is predicted total goal differential in the second half of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

FROM and TO location of the shot, which could potentially give us the angle of the shot, and then how it was scored, left foot, right foot, header, butter, green bean, blue bean. whatever… Funny, it makes me feel confident that I had some thought a long the same lines as you. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night we talked about the eight teams still in the playoffs in a round-robin-style discussion, and then followed up the playoff talk with a general discussion about numbers. Specifically we talked about often-quoted and used statistics that don’t really hold any value. I also pretty much alienate all lawyers who listen to the podcast. Enjoy!

      <title>Jamison Olave's Value to New York</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was quite a popular tweet from a canine about New York’s improved play this season when Jamison Olave was playing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GothamistDan/status/397398611438608384&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/GothamistDan/status/397398611438608384&lt;/a&gt; There are obviously confounding factors at play here, not to mention small sample sizes. There were only seven matches this season in which Olave did not start, and eight in which he played 45 minutes or less. Any data obtained from these games is going to be subject to A) small sample sizes, B) lots of variance in the response variable (goals or wins), and C) no control for quality of opponent or location of the match. To deal with the small sample size/variance problem, I’m going to use our now &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/shot-locations/team-by-team-shot-locations/&quot;&gt;semi-famous data set&lt;/a&gt; on shot location origins. Steven Fenn kindly &lt;a href=&quot;http://theshinguardian.com/2013/10/31/mls-playoff-ball-who-are-the-belles/&quot;&gt;showed the world&lt;/a&gt; their predictive value, and to me that means that expected goals for and against are the most stable stat available for such an analysis. To control for New York’s opponents—-when Olave was both in and out of the starting XI—-I have included each of New York’s opponent’s expected goals data in the linear regression, while also accounting for whether or not the Red Bulls were at home. Blah, blah, blah, to the results! Looking at the defensive side, New York allowed shots leading to 0.24 fewer expected goals against in games that Olave started. That seems to indicate New York’s need for Olave, but the p-value was a kind-of-high 26 percent. Overall, New York’s expected goal differential climbed 0.19 goals in those games that Olave started, though again, the p-value was quite high at 46 percent.&lt;em&gt; Now for your shitty conclusion, courtesy of shitty p-values: Olave’s influence on New York’s level of play this season was questionable. There is some suggestion that he helped reduce goal-scoring against, however there is a reasonable chance that that difference was due to other, not-measured-here variables. What I am more comfortable claiming is that he does &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; make a 0.86-goal difference on the defensive side. The point is this. New York’s shot creation and goal scoring ability, for and against, are more a function of whether or not the Red Bulls are home, and against whom they are playing. Not as much whether Olave starts. Obviously putting an inferior player into the starting XI isn’t going to help New York out. But, as I always question, do we really know how to value soccer players at all? Maybe Olave just doesn’t make that much of a difference. After all, he’s only one of eleven players. _&lt;/em&gt;For those curious, the number of minutes Olave played was a worse predictor variable than the simple binary variable of whether or not he started. Controlling for the strength of opponent was necessary since perhaps Mr. Petke was more likely to sit Olave against a worse opponent at home, or something like that._&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rosales, not Dempsey, is the clear choice for Seattle's set-piece crosses</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Seattle’s 2-1 loss to Portland on Saturday, Clint Dempsey took all of the Sounders’ attacking set-pieces in the first half. He was impressive with his free kick shots on goal, clipping the crossbar and forcing Donovan Ricketts into multiple saves. But his corner kicks left much to be desired. Mauro Rosales subbed on in the 63rd minute and took the remainder of the set-piece crosses and created more chances. With Lamar Neagle suspended for yellow card accumulation and Seattle needing goals in leg two, Rosales seems likely to start. Requisite warning about small sample sizes aside, based off of the results in leg one, the data suggest Sigi Schmidt would be wise to let Rosales take over set-piece crossing duties in the second leg. Here’s how Dempsey’s nine corners and one free kick cross went in leg one: &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/dempseyleg1fks.jpg?w=300&quot; alt=&quot;DempseyLeg1FKs&quot;&gt; 3rd minute corner: To the near post, cleared by Diego Chara 6th corner: Near post, cleared by Will Johnson 20th corner: Near post, cleared by Will Johnson 25th corner: Near post, cleared by Chara 32nd corner: Near post, cleared by Chara 38th corner: Top of the six yard box, cleared by Pa-Moudou Kah 38th corner: Top of six, cleared by Kah 39th free kick: Cross from 18 yards out on the wing to the top of the six, cleared by Futty Danso 45th corner: Near post, punched clear by Ricketts In the second half, Rosales took all three Seattle corners and two free kick crosses: &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/rosalesleg1fks.jpg?w=300&quot; alt=&quot;RosalesLeg1FKs&quot;&gt; 68th minute corner: To the penalty spot, shot by Djimi Traore, saved by Ricketts 69th corner: Top of six, Headed cross by Dempsey  blocked by Zemanski and eventually caught by Ricketts 82nd free kick: Cross from 38 yards in the center to the penalty spot, cleared by Danso 86th free kick: Cross from 28 yards on the wing to the edge of the penalty box, headed by Shalrie Joseph across the box 87th corner: Penalty spot, Headed shot by Dempsey off of the crossbar and out In summary: Dempsey had 10 set-piece crosses, none of which reached a Seattle teammate. Rosales had five set-piece crosses, four of which found a teammate in the box, and three of which led to shots. As you can tell, it was a tale of two halves. In the first, Dempsey’s crosses rarely cleared the first defender, and none found another Sounders player. In the second half, four of Rosales’ five crosses created chances, two off of the head of Dempsey himself. If Seattle is going to win at Jeld-Wen Field on Thursday, they’ll need to do better with their crosses. Based on their chances in game one, it looks to be in the Sounders’ best interest to allow Rosales to take the free kick crosses in game two. Not only did his crosses create better chances than Dempsey in game one, but Deuce seems to be more dangerous getting on the end of crosses than he is at taking them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Closer Look At The MLS MVP Race</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: __This was the first of many articles by &lt;strong&gt;Jacob&lt;/strong&gt;, who can be found at @MLSAtheist on twitter. It’s quite amazing, and I encourage you to read it. He’s one of several wonderful writers that we are adding to the site in the coming weeks. Please give him a follow and good feedback, as you have for Drew, Matty, and me. This is all part of putting together newer, better site content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, I saw a piece on ESPN handicapping the MLS MVP race, featuring the one and only Alexi Lalas. Say what you will about Lalas, but what he said on this topic got my mind jogging. The season was still a couple weeks from being complete, but the Redhead tipped &lt;strong&gt;Marco Di Vaio&lt;/strong&gt; over &lt;strong&gt;Mike Magee&lt;/strong&gt; for the award, based mostly on his higher goal total. He explained that goals are the rarest and most important event in soccer, so the guy who scores the most (and in the most games, giving his team a better chance to win) is the best candidate for the award. But here at American Soccer Analysis, we know that just because a guy puts the final touch on a goal doesn’t necessarily make him the most valuable component of that play, let alone that season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Lalas had a point: goals are important. And whether you like it or not, goal scorers and creators are always going to be the award winners in this sport. But still, looking solely at goal totals seems far too simplistic when handicapping the race for MVP. So, as we are wont to do around here, I tried to delve a little deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, you can contribute to goals without being the one to actually kick it into the net. I’ll do the most obvious thing possible, and just add assists to the equation. Additionally, not every player gets to play the same amount. Especially in MLS, where some of the top players are constantly called away for international duty, some MVP candidates only play in two-thirds of his team’s games. But if the premise here is that the award is intended to go to the most prolific goal creator, we should really look at how many goals they create when they’re actually on the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the ten top MVP candidates (I know they probably aren’t all that deserving, but ten is a good round number and I’m a little OCD), and how many goals they’ve created, as well as their per 90 minute rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Player&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assists&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G+A Per 90&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M. Magee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.806&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M. Di Vaio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.698&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Keane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.22&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Morales&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.710&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camilo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.04&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. Valeri&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.909&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F. Higuain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.694&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. Fagundez&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.742&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T. Cahill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.642&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G. Zusi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.535&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise to see Keane and &lt;strong&gt;Camilo&lt;/strong&gt; leading the way with over one per game, as they have the highest sum of goals and assists, and Keane did his work in fairly limited minutes. But again, goals and assists are a little too superficial for us here at ASA. After all, some goals are the fault of terrible defending, goalkeeping, or just some really fortunate bounces; instead it’s preferred to look at chance creation. If a player is consistently creating chances, it’s nearly inevitable that it should lead to more goals. Now rather than just the shots that actually end up in the net, we’ll run the numbers regarding shots, as well as passes that lead to shots (key passes) for the same players:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Player&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Passes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shots Created Per 90&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M. Magee*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;114&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;65&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.77&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M. Di Vaio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;89&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.62&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Keane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;54&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;53&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.86&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Morales&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;33&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;94&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.01&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camilo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;95&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;37&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.91&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. Valeri&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;55&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;59&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.51&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F. Higuain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;69&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;115&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.39&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. Fagundez&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;43&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.60&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T. Cahill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;47&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.65&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G. Zusi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;41&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;75&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.43&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we’ve got a couple of different leaders, as &lt;strong&gt;Federico Higuain&lt;/strong&gt; and Mike Magee take the lead thanks to their trigger-happy styles. Higuain’s incredible number of key passes, despite playing for a middling Crew team, should raise some eyebrows—-the dude’s an absolutely fantastic attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I have an issue with just looking at shots created. After all, we know not all shots are &lt;a href=&quot;https://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/shot-locations/&quot;&gt;created equal&lt;/a&gt;. Without looking up the shot location data of every one of the shots in the above table, I think there’s still a way to improve the statistics: add in a factor of accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Higuain, creating over six shots a game is terrific. But from watching a lot of Columbus games, I can tell you that plenty of those shots were low percentage bombs from 30 yards out, and plenty of others were taken by other fairly inept Crew attackers. To try to factor this in, I’d like to look at how many shots on target each player creates - the ones that actually have a chance at becoming goals. While shots on goal stats for individual players are easy to find, it’s tougher to decipher when key passes lead to shots that test keepers rather than boots into the stands. To compensate, I used each player’s team percentage of shots on target to estimate how many key passes turned into shots on goal, leading to the final following table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Player&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shots on Goal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Passes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team Shot%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoG Created Per 90&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M. Magee*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;65&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;48% / 51%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.68&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M. Di Vaio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;56&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;54%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.21&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Keane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;31&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;53&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;48%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.56&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Morales&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;94&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;52%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.68&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camilo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;56&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;37&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;49%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.76&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. Valeri&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;31&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;59&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;49%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.36&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F. Higuain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;36&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;115&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;43%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.96&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. Fagundez&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.57&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T. Cahill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;48%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.25&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G. Zusi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;75&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;42%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There we have it. My endorsement for MVP this season, based on a combination of Alexi Lalas’ inspiration and my own twisted statistical mind, is Federico Higuain of the 16th-best team in the league, the Columbus Crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just kidding, guys! Obviously the MVP debate should take more into account than who creates shots on goal. Defense, leadership, your team actually winning—-all of these things should and do matter. But still, I think this was an interesting exercise and hopefully opened at least one set of eyes to how prolific Higuain is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a few thoughts/takeaways in bullet form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higuain was held back by his team’s terrible shooting accuracy, but not as much as Graham Zusi. Now I understand why analytic folks like Sporting Kansas City’s chance creation so much, yet the team hasn’t always seen the results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diego Fagundez is incredibly selective about his shooting - almost 70% of his shots hit the target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Javi Morales doesn’t shoot much for being so prolific at creating others shots. Reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;http://tempofreesoccer.blogspot.com/2013/09/2013-mls-top-shot-contributors.html&quot;&gt;this post by Tempo Free Soccer&lt;/a&gt;-—really interesting as far as categorizing attackers as shooters vs. providers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Since Magee was traded mid-season, his season total stats were harder to find. While I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://squawka.com/&quot;&gt;Squawka &lt;/a&gt;for everyone else’s stats, I ended up having to tally Magee’s game-by-game stats from &lt;a href=&quot;http://whoscored.com/&quot;&gt;Who Scored&lt;/a&gt;. It’s possible that the two sites have different standards for what constitutes a shot or key pass, and that could’ve skewed the data for Magee. I’m not sure any of them look too far out of whack that I’m too suspicious, but it’s possible so I thought it should be noted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two-legged Series Probabilities</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/two-legged-series-probabilities/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/two-legged-series-probabilities/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is hard to construct probabilistic models for two-legged, home-and-home series based on a season of games that were all independent of one another (for the most part). And because our data sets from Opta and MLSsoccer.com only go back to 2011, there isn’t much of a sample size to work with come playoff time. Thus I will have to get tricky when trying to construct logical probabilities of victory in these playoff series. The first thing to point out is that our model is based on regular season games that may or may not act like two-legged playoff series. There is a common belief that the team that plays at home for the second leg has an additional advantage. However, much of that belief likely comes from people like Simon Borg, who likes &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/10/29/mls-history-gives-edge-playoff-teams-hosting-2nd-leg&quot;&gt;shitting on data and the presenting it.&lt;/a&gt; A reasonable study would need to account for the fact that the team playing at home is probably better. One such study &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=9&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;ved=0CH0QFjAI&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fepub.ub.uni-muenchen.de%2F11483%2F1%2Ftr080.pdf&amp;amp;ei=8_F_UoG0J5CgyAHM3YCIDg&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHVROZx2Gktc_kPVVsLvnyO5n7kWw&amp;amp;sig2=SEZJLFcrzBg9ppqMvF1QIA&amp;amp;bvm=bv.56146854,d.aWc&quot;&gt;attempted to do so&lt;/a&gt; for the UEFA Champion’s League, and found that the additional advantage due to hosting the second game was effectively nothing once team skill was controlled for. However, it should be noted that UEFA Champions League does not always play extra time when aggregate scores are tied. As Borg notes, 22 of 36 (61.1%) two-legged series in the MLS playoffs have been won by the team that played the second leg at home. However, because home teams tend to be better, much of that is likely due to skill, and not an additional home-field edge. Our models, which don’t give any &lt;em&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; home-boost for second-leg home teams, projected three second-leg home teams to win in the first round top win: Portland with 69 percent, Sporting with 66 percent, and New York with 59 percent. Even factoring in RSL’s 46 percent, the average percent of second-leg home teams expected to win in the first round was almost exactly—-you guessed it—-60 percent. With the data currently available, we have chosen not to include an additional home boost for second-leg home teams. With that out of the way…moving on! With two first-leg games down and two to go, we see two favorites in opposite positions. Portland is taking a one-goal lead back home, while Sporting returns to Kansas City facing a one-goal deficit. My method of projecting each team’s probability of winning its series will be derived from the assumption that teams favor a regulation win to a regulation draw on aggregate (and a draw to a loss) with the same weighted preferences as it would have favored those outcomes during the regular season. Thus, for example, I will treat the Portland-Seattle matchup as though Portland has an early lead in a regular-season-type game, and adjust our model’s probabilities according to that one-goal lead. The probabilities will be adjusted based on some &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/projects/game-states/&quot;&gt;game states research&lt;/a&gt; I have been working on. I have shown some nifty graphs below to help us out. The two graphs chart the approximate probability that the home team has of each of the three possible match outcomes based on two things: the goal differential and the minute mark. These graphs were created from game data up through June 8th of this season. The data was smoothed out using a lowess curve. &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/plus-one-goal-diff-win-expectancy-thru-6-8-13.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Plus One Goal Diff Win Expectancy \(thru 6-8-13\)&quot;&gt; Portland essentially leads a home match by one goal in the first minute. A league-average team would win this type of match with an estimated 75-percent probability and tie with about 20-percent probability.&lt;em&gt; Another way to say the same thing is to say that the home team has 3-to-1 (3.00) odds of winning, and 1-to-4 (0.25) odds of tying. Through June 8th of this season, typical home teams won with 46-percent probability (0.85 odds) and tied with 29-percent probability (0.41 odds). Thus I can say that a typical team increases its odds of winning from 0.85 to about 3.00, a factor of 3.53, with an early one-goal lead. Additionally a typical team decreases its odds of tying by a factor of about 1.6 with that one-goal lead. .Portland’s odds of beating Seattle at home from an even game state are approximately 2.00 (66.7%), and its odds of tying are approximately 0.23 (18.8%). Using the appropriate odds ratios, one might conjecture that the Timbers’ odds of winning &lt;em&gt;this _game on aggregate are about 7.06 (87.6%), and it odds of tying this game are 0.14 (12.3%). A tie would essentially result in the coin-flipping grand finale known as penalty kicks, and thus &lt;strong&gt;Portland’s chances of a Conference Finals berth are 93.8 percent&lt;/strong&gt; (.876 + 0.5 x .123). &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/minus-one-goal-diff-win-expectancy-thru-6-8-13.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Minus One Goal Diff Win Expectancy \(thru 6-8-13\)&quot;&gt; Instead of going all nutzoid on Sporting KC as I did with Portland, one can trust that I followed the same methodology to arrive at my final conclusion. &lt;strong&gt;Sporting’s chances to advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals are about 47.8 percent&lt;/strong&gt; by this use of odds ratios.** These probabilities will go into the simulation after all first legs are complete to update the &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/cup-chances-2013/&quot;&gt;overall Cup probabilities.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Due to a small sample size of plus-one goal differentials in the first 15 minutes of matches, the graph is trying to make us believe that a loss is more probable than a tie, when our logic should allow us to infer that—-with a one-goal lead—-a draw would be more probable than a loss. Thus I am using the more-stabilized figures around the 40-to-60-minute marks. The even goal differential graph—-not shown—-as well as the two graphs above suggest that probabilities don’t begin to change all that much until the 60th minute, an interesting topic for another day.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;**For those wanting to check my math, I assumed typical home teams in SKC’s position would win with 20-percent, probability and tie with 30-percent probability. SKC’s probabilities against New England in an even game state would be 64-percent and 26-percent for a win and tie, respectively. _&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/two-legged-series-probabilities/#122&quot; title=&quot;2013-11-03 17:07:19&quot;&gt;Amir&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it’s very logical that a loss is almost as probable as a draw, even with an early one goal lead. Think about a theoretical scenario where each team has 10 goals on average. An early lead doesn’t mean much, and the probability of draw is very small. Now in a more realistic scenario, try and do the same with 1.5 goals on average and you get 19.7% for a draw and 18.2% for a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/two-legged-series-probabilities/#123&quot; title=&quot;2013-11-03 19:31:17&quot;&gt;Matthias Kullowatz&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Are using, like, normal probability theory sort of? Say two teams are expected to score 1.5 goals on average with some standard deviation? The problem is that the game’s outcome is so discrete. Not that you couldn’t still derive usable probabilities from a continuous distribution model, though…it’s a tough one, but I like where your head’s at. There seems to be some stabilization of regressed probabilities around 40 - 60 minutes, so I went with something close to that. I definitely need to get more data from past seasons and playoffs to get a firmer answer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, it’s only been a few days, but our trio returns with a vengeance. We preview the MLS playoff matchups, with the exception of Houston-New York (though we allude to it plenty). It’s a short podcast—-just one segment long. Have a listen. [audio &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/asa-episode-xxvii.mp3&quot;&gt;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/asa-episode-xxvii.mp3&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Show Down: Juan Agudelo vs. Diego Fagundez</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/show-down-juan-agudelo-vs-diego-fagundez/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During our podcast on Thursday night, a short side conversation was sparked between Drew and me. Who would you take in a situation where you are starting a new team: &lt;strong&gt;Juan Agudelo&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Diego Fagundez&lt;/strong&gt;. While the question and how it’s presented matters (i.e. how many years of control do you have, salary cap situation, blah, blah, blah) because it gives us context, let’s not go there. The discussion here is more about the general response. We’ve all, myself included, just generally assumed that the answer to any question between the two is: “Agudelo now, Fagundez later”. But what makes us think that Fagundez isn’t the better option right now? While doing our podcast I generally have between 9 and 15 browser tabs open with general bits of information. I’m sure my wife would argue that it’s more like 50. Whatever. It’s a lot. During that point in the podcast, I had Squawka up and quoted a total performance score of &lt;strong&gt;452&lt;/strong&gt; for Fagundez, as opposed to Juan Agudelo and his shockingly low score of only &lt;strong&gt;57&lt;/strong&gt;. So, the response then transforms itself from the answer that we thought we were sure of, to understanding what exactly Agudelo has done over the course of the season. Trust me, I get that numbers, especially in soccer, can’t tell an entire story. But they can help see us things that our brains don’t naturally keep track of. Agudelo, in my mind, is a special case of a lot of talent doing one specific thing and being credited for far more than perhaps initially thought. I know the other side of that argument stresses his physical traits and goal-scoring ability. Sure, those are two HUGE things when it comes to this game. Speed kills and Agudelo knows how to turn it on. Let’s take a look below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mins

First, we can see one thing. And it’s quiet amazing. Together, the two players produced 20 goals on 60 shots. Take a second to think about that because that’s major. The Revolution took 37 shots and scored just &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; goal over their first &lt;strong&gt;five&lt;/strong&gt; matches of the season. These guys get thrown into the line-up and procure 20 goals on just 60 shots. That’s special. Second, what is most obviously the difference between the two is the number of chances created. You’ll see in a second that Agudelo still made a fine amount of passes. The issue isn’t that he’s a ball hog, or that he just wants the chances for himself. The problem is those passes did not become chances on goal. You’d hope that a guy who gets plenty of attention from the defense has the ability to find open teammates that can create goals. &lt;/p&gt;

Alright, onto the possession-based stuff. There are some interesting thoughts here. Such as Agudelo taking less dribbles, making shorter passes, and making more of them. It’s not something that I would have generally have thought of about him. I think of an individual who is looking to constantly run at defenders, but maybe that isn’t the whole picture. That said, he’s still losing the ball quiet a bit, and while Fagundez doesn’t make as many passes, he’s less error-prone and creates more pockets of space up the field with the ball at his feet. &lt;/p&gt;

The biggest number that stands out to me on this page is the number of fouls committed per 90 minutes by Agudelo. There is no way he makes that many fouls and continues to only pull about 6 cards over the course of a full season. That’s impossible. Outside of that, you see that each of these players is rather close to one another. One is a bit more on top of clearances while the other interceptions. Really, that’s probably due to two random factors. 1) Agudelo is in the middle of the box more often for corner kicks, and 2) Fagundez works in the midfield where errant passes are more probable. It’s important to realize these players aren’t like for like. Trying to compare them as apples to apples isn’t going to work and makes this work less productive. I am willing to acknowledge that. Agudelo did have some opportunities in the midfield this season, however, he was primarily featured up top in the striker role. Likewise, Fagundez had some exciting moments playing center forward, but was primarily used out wide as a left midfielder. Because they don’t occupy the same space, certain statistical attributes that we associate with these players are going to be either more or less inflated. They have different responsibilities so they aren’t going to be the same player statistically. We don’t have a “Wins Above Replacement” calculator, as awesome as that would be. There is no key that unlocks all events and makes them equal, as if to say this player is better than that player, regardless of position or team. Maybe this post was a complete waste because we should be comparing these two teammates to the rest of the league, rather than to each other. What I do know is that Fagundez is less a player of the future and more of an MLS standout &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, but when Agudelo leaves for Stoke, he is still going to be missed by the Revs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, a crazy lot happened this weekend, and we are here for a bit of a rewind. We give you our take and how we enjoyed the last week of the MLS season. Also, some thoughts on various things that happened and some added talk about MLS expansion. I give a bit of a dissertation on the state of the Sounders, Matty (of course) mentions shot ratios and Drew has some excellent commentary on coaches. We conclude with some discussion on how goalkeepers may better be valued, and how we are going to try to tackle that project. This was the last week of the regular season, enjoy.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think this is about as opportune a time as any to do this, so I’m just going to throw it out there. While I’ve been saying it for a while, we’re really going to reboot this site to make data much more accessible, articles more engaging, and the experience more palatable.&lt;em&gt; However, baby steps. We need some volunteers to make a lot of this happen. People that can help us collect specific pieces of data that we aren’t able to poll or scrap. People that can help us transition this site into something usable. People to take the data we find, make something of it and write about it—-tell people how this data can transform the beautiful game that we watch. This isn’t about us, and it never has been. We all want to give back to this soccer analytics community in the best possible way. This has been my vision from the start, and I was lucky enough to find two awesome dudes to kick it off with. We would love to see more hands join us in this process.&lt;strong&gt; I’m not asking for money. Actually, I’m asking for something much more valuable than that, your time. We want to know who else is out there that is like the three of us, and that wants to dive into these numbers, explore them, and improve our understanding of soccer. If this interests you, please e-mail me at farfromport[at]gmail.com. I’d love to have more brains that can think out these problems, come up with solutions and more efficient methods,  and ultimately refine what I am doing wrong. We’re about to head into the off-season, which lasts only about three months, and it gives us little time to make these changes. The three of us all have important ladies in our lives, cats, other animals, families and college degrees to complete. Oh, and of course, full-time jobs too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; We aren’t asking for your full lives, just some help. Thanks, Harrison Crow Matthias Kullowatz Drew Olsen &lt;em&gt;This is one of the biggest words Harrison has ever used correctly. &lt;strong&gt;Harrison is a soccer data socialist. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Matthias claims to work full-time. His friends are skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Playoff Probabilities and Seeding</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that the “Playoff Push” has given way to the actual playoffs, we have included the probabilities of &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/cup-chances-2013/&quot;&gt;all the various outcomes&lt;/a&gt; in this year’s edition of the MLS Cup. One sees that our model’s darling, Sporting Kansas City, has the best chances at an MLS Cup trophy of all teams, which is not surprising. But what this simulation really articulated to me were the differences between the three, four, and five seeds in each conference, as well as the top seeds overall. Despite the fact that our model thinks that fifth-seeded Colorado is nearly as good as Portland and Real Salt Lake, its chances at the MLS Cup are significantly lower as a five seed. Having to play that extra match on the road essentially chops the Rapids’ chances in half right away, and then its slight disadvantage in a home-and-home against Portland—-a 42-percent chance in that series—-leaves Colorado with just a 3.2-percent chance at the silverware. In the Eastern Conference, the same issue arises for fourth-seeded Houston. The Dynamo are not thought to be significantly worse than New York—-the model projects the Red Bulls to win that potential home-and-home matchup with 59-percent probability—-but the additional uncertainty of the play-in game really screws them over. The three seeds, however, are well-represented in Cup probabilities. Though New England’s Cup chances sit at just 5.1 percent, you have to remember that they play Sporting KC in the first round. We love SKC around here, if you weren’t aware. And then Los Angeles, the West’s third-seeded team, actually has the third-best chance &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;overall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at a Cup win—-15.0 percent. Finally, the potential for home-field advantage in an MLS Cup Final really has Sporting and New York drooling. Together those two teams hog nearly 44 percent of all the Cup probability. Given that Sporting makes the finals, the probability that it goes on to win them is about 64 percent (26.5/41.2). New York’s conditional probability is similar at about 62 percent (17.4/27.9). That home-field advantage gives each of those teams a huge boost &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  they can make it that far. For Cinderella teams that make it that far, having to play a superior opponent on the road in the championship one-game-off doesn’t bode well for a storybook ending. Keep track of all the playoff outcome probabilities on our &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/cup-chances-2013/&quot;&gt;Cup Chances 2013&lt;/a&gt; page under MLS Tables.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After completing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/10/22/eastern-conference-playoff-seeding/&quot;&gt;Eastern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/10/22/western-conference-playoff-seeding/&quot;&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; Conference playoff scenarios yesterday, it only makes sense to move on to each team’s chances at the Supporters’ Shield and a potential home-field advantage in the MLS Cup Final. Only four teams could mathematically win the shield: New York, Sporting KC, Portland and Real Salt Lake. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has the best chance due its current lead in the tables and the fact that it’s playing a home game. If New York wins at home against Chicago, then it will be the Shield winner, regardless of other outcomes, but that’s not the only way the Red Bulls could hoist the trophy. A tie against Chicago would eliminate both RSL and Portland from contention—-since New York holds the “wins” tie-breaker over Portland—-and then an SKC tie or loss would leave the Red Bulls as Shield winners, as well. In fact, even a loss from New York could leave them in first overall if SKC, Portland and RSL all don’t win. However, it’s not probable that both Portland and RSL would each earn less than three points against Chivas USA. In the end, New York’s Shield chances sit at 73.7 percent, with 61.8 percent of that coming from its probability of beating Chicago this weekend. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sporting Kansas City&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has the next-best chance at the trophy at 15.5 percent. Obviously it needs New York to lose or tie and then—-due to SKC losing the potential tie-breaker to New York,—-SKC would need to win. The only scenario where SKC ties and still gets the Shield involves crazy scenarios like an 8-to-8 tie with Philly. Like SKC, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real Salt**&lt;/strong&gt; Lake**&lt;/em&gt; both need to win, and then things need to go their way. RSL would (likely) hold tie-breakers over both SKC and New York, so RSL would need SKC to lose or tie, Portland to lose or tie, and then New York has to lose. Portland loses tie-breakers to SKC and New York, so it needs to win, and then have SKC lose or tie and New York lose. In the end, Portland’s probability at the Supporters’ Shield is just 6.0 percent, while RSL’s is 4.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Eastern Conference Playoff Seeding</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/eastern-conference-playoff-seeding/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I put together the &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/10/22/western-conference-playoff-seeding/&quot;&gt;Western Conference version &lt;/a&gt;earlier, but the Eastern Conference and its four million more scenarios are so much more exciting. I used our &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/power-rankings-2013/&quot;&gt;predictive model&lt;/a&gt; to calculate the probabilities of each game’s outcome, and then applied those to all possible scenarios. This is going to be fun… New York and Sporting KC have locked up a one-two finish in some order, and then there are five teams with mathematically &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;-zero chances at the final three playoff spots in the East. There are no San Joses here, as each of Montreal, Chicago, New England, Houston and Philly all have real chances of at least eight percent at a playoff berth. On to the scenarios! The &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York Red Bulls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; can guarantee themselves both first place in the East and a Supporters’ Shield trophy with a win at home against Chicago this weekend, but that’s not the only way it could take the top seed. A tie against Chicago coupled with SKC not winning, or losses by both New York and SKC would leave the Red Bulls in first place, as well. Totaled up, the Red Bulls chances at a top seed sit at 84.5 percent, with the other 15.5 percent going to a second place finish. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sporting Kansas City&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;‘s outcomes are the exact opposite of those of New York. SKC has to play on the road in Philly while New York plays in a more comfortable home environment, leaving SKC with a 15.5-percent chance of a first place finish. SKC has been our loving model’s favorite team in the East since the model was born, and a two-seed shouldn’t hurt its chances of a date in the MLS Cup final. Despite limping into the postseason, its comeback win against the Union has &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Montreal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on firmer ground going into the last week. A win at Toronto guarantees the Impact third place in the East, allowing them to avoid that one-game-off. In total, Montreal has a 53.1-percent chance at third place—-remember, the model doesn’t think the Impact are &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/power-rankings-2013/&quot;&gt;all that much better&lt;/a&gt; than Toronto, but at least they don’t have to go through customs. The sequences leading to fourth or fifth place start to become more complicated, but those probabilities are 31.7 and 13.4 percent, respectively. That leaves the Impact with just a 1.8-percent chance of missing out on the playoffs altogether, a scenario that essentially requires a poor result from Montreal with wins from New England and Houston, and at least a draw for Chicago on the road in New York. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chicago&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is in a surprisingly good position going into its game in New York. The outcomes leading to the Fire making the playoffs add up to 93.7 percent. 17.1 percent of that leaves Chicago in third, which would require Montreal to lose or tie and Chicago to subsequently earn a tie or win, depending on Montreal’s result. And there’s more good news for Chicago. If it gets stuck in the play-in game, it has a better chance of being the home team (43.8 percent) than the away team (32.8 percent). Chicago would win any potential tie-breakers with New England, Houston, &lt;em&gt;and _Philly, which is partly why its playoff chances are so high. The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New England Revolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; could avoid the play-in game, but that would require a win at Columbus in addition to both Chicago and Montreal not winning. Our model suggests that probability is only 12.5 percent. If it makes the play-in game, New England is more likely do so as the fifth seed (30.2 percent) than the fourth seed (8.2 percent). Those of you keeping score at home know that the Revolution’s chances of missing the playoffs altogether are thus 49.1 percent, the most probable outcome of the four. Though New England holds the goals-for tie-breaker over Houston, Houston has an easier opponent in D.C. United. Speaking of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Houston&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, due to that easier, aforementioned opponent, Houston has a better shot of claiming third place than New England at 17.3 percent. However that tie-breaker plays to New England’s favor in all of the ways that each team could finish fourth or fifth. The Dynamo have just a 16.3-percent chance at fourth, and a 15.6% chance at fifth, leaving them out of the playoffs with 50.9-percent probability. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/strong&gt;_’s best chance at the playoffs comes from the fact that they would almost surely win a tie-breaker to Houston if it came to that. A Philly win coupled with a Houston tie would leave both tied at 49 points and 13 wins. Philly currently leads Houston by two goals scored and holds the third tie-breaker, goal differential, as well. Essentially, in this scenario, Houston would have to tie something like 4 - 4, while Philly slipped past SKC 1 - 0. Not likely, so this scenario would lead to Philly’s only real shot at the playoffs, an 8.0-percent chance at fifth place. There is no mathematical way the Union could do better than fifth, as it would lose potential tie-breakers to both Chicago and Montreal. In conclusion, for your viewing pleasure, the table of probabilities: &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Western Conference Playoff Seeding</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/western-conference-playoff-seeding/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/western-conference-playoff-seeding/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past few weeks, we have been including each team’s probabilities of earning a playoff spot and each team’s probabilities of winning the Supporters’ Shield (for most points in MLS). Due to the complexity of the tie-breaker system, I have avoided that topic altogether. Until now. Now that every team with at least 7 caring fans has just one match remaining—-Chivas USA has two—-I have recalculated the actual playoff chances below using our model, accounting for the various tie-breakers. Let’s get started easy. The five Western Conference playoff teams may not be &lt;em&gt;mathematically&lt;/em&gt; determined; however, by probability, the top five teams &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt; are certain to remain the same. San Jose could tie Seattle and/or Colorado for the fifth-and-final spot, but the first tie-breaker is total wins, and Seattle has that one covered. The second tie-breaker (which would go into effect only against Colorado) is goals scored. Right now San Jose trails Colorado by 12 goals, meaning that San Jose would have to score &lt;em&gt;at least 13&lt;/em&gt; goals to win all the relevant tie-breakers. So yes, the top five in the West can safely be etched in stone. Seeds are still important, though. Earning a top-three finish allows a team to avoid that one-game playoff between the fourth and fifth-ranked teams in each conference. Below I have given some relevant probabilities for each team’s seeding: The&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portland Timbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; could theoretically finish anywhere from first to fourth, though with their final game against Chivas, first place is the most likely. Our model gives Portland a 52-percent chance to beat Chivas on the road and lock up the top spot regardless of other outcomes. However, a tie or loss to Chivas leaves the door wide open for the other playoff teams, and thus Portland’s &lt;em&gt;overall&lt;/em&gt; chances at first place increase only marginally to about 54 percent. Its chances of a dreaded fourth-place finish require a string of results that has just a four-percent likelihood. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Real Salt Lake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; guarantees itself at least second place in the West with a win. It has about a 42-percent shot at first place, and only a one-percent shot at fourth place—-a result that would require a loss to Chivas at home, a Colorado win at Vancouver, and a tie between Los Angeles and Seattle. Thus both RSL and Portland are not likely to find themselves playing in a one-game playoff, and even in that worst-case scenario, either team would get to play at home. Probabilities surround the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LA Galaxy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are a little trickier. Finishing in first place would require a win against the Sounders in addition to Chivas getting points in consecutive matches against RSL and the Timbers. That probability is only about three percent. There is, however, a very real chance that the Galaxy finish in fourth or fifth. A loss to Seattle coupled with a Colorado win leaves them in fifth, while a tie in Seattle and a Colorado win would drop LA to fourth. Those probabilities are 11 and 10 percent, respectively. Thus the remaining 76 percent has the Galaxy finishing in either third or second place. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seattle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;‘s football club could finish anywhere between first and fifth. The unlikely sequence that would vault the Sounders into first place includes them beating the Galaxy, Chivas getting points at RSL on Wednesday, and then Chivas returning home to beat Portland at home on Saturday…but that has just a one-percent likelihood. A loss or tie against the Galaxy locks Seattle into the play-in game. Though playing at home, &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/power-rankings-2013/&quot;&gt;our model&lt;/a&gt; really likes LA and gives the Sounders just a 30-percent chance of winning that matchup. That leaves them with a 32-percent chance at fourth and a 38-percent chance at fifth place. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colorado&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is in a rough spot, as it would lose potential tie-breakers to Seattle, LA and RSL. Taking first place would require that Colorado win at Vancouver, that Portland and RSL both lose to Chivas, and that Seattle and LA tie. That string of events has virtually a zero-percent chance of happening. Colorado is much more likely to find itself in fifth place. A loss would guarantee the Rapids the last playoff spot, and a tie would stick them there, too, so long as Seattle earned at least a point against LA. All that adds up to a 51-percent chance at finishing fifth and having to play a one-game playoff on the road. Here’s the chart that sums up all of the probabilities for each playoff contender: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st&lt;/strong&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a short discussion on twitter here, is the record of the LA Galaxy with &lt;strong&gt;Jaime Penedo&lt;/strong&gt; and then again without him. It’s an extremely small sample size (7 games with vs. 25 without), and so you have to, of course, approach it with a sense of skepticism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Penedo Status&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;PPG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with Jaime Penedo
1.44&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without Jaime Penedo
1.57
How good are they? Are they an MLS Cup contender? Well… I generally believe once you get to the playoffs you’re a contender regardless. But the question still remains, can the Galaxy still be a team that wins silverware? Maybe, maybe not. It’s really hard to judge at this point. For what it’s worth, I think it’s clear that they are a much better team with him than without. Small sample sizes leave me with only my eyes. Also, I still think they made a mistake signing &lt;strong&gt;Omar Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; to DP contract. I guess that’s another can of worms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Game of the Week: Seattle at Portland</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/game-of-the-week-seattle-at-portland/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We spent a fair amount of time talking about this match on &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/10/11/asa-podcast-xxv-the-one-where-we-go-full-west-coast-mostly/&quot;&gt;Thursday night’s podcast&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested in that sort of thing.&lt;/em&gt; Coming into this match, form might be one of the most discussed topics. Seattle has earned just two points in its last four games, while Portland has earned eight points over that same span. In my opinion, form only means something if there’s an obvious reason as to its recent fluctuation. For Seattle, there is no obvious reason for its poor play. Seattle has been bad the last four matches in terms of results, but they have actually outshot those opponents 56-to-41. The real effect on form this game will likely be the fact that Brad Evans and Eddie Johnson are out due to international duty—-technically, though in Johnson’s case it’s more &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.seattletimes.com/soundersfc/2013/10/10/eddie-johnson-suffers-groin-injury-with-usmnt-taken-off-roster-for-world-cup-qualifiers/&quot;&gt;his injury&lt;/a&gt; that’s going to keep him out. The Timbers will be without Rodney Wallace, Ryan Johnson and Alvas Powell. However, the Timbers’ Johnson is not nearly the potential threat as that of the Sounders, and Powell has been in a reserve role since the return of Jack Jewsbury and Futty Danso. The absences seem to favor the Timbers. The stats suggest that Portland is a somewhat heavy favorite this match. Playing in front of Jeldwen’s home fans, with better shot rates and finishing rates on the season, our model suggests the Timbers have a 52-percent probability of winning against the Sounders’ 19 percent. This really shouldn’t be surprising, as we’ve seen the strong predictive ability of both home-field advantage and shots rates. What might be slightly more surprising is the effect of this match on the Supporters’ Shield race. In the event of a Portland win, our season simulation suggests Portland would catapult to nearly a 45-percent chance at (at least a share of) the Shield, and Seattle would fall to below five percent (2.3%). However, if Seattle pulls off the upset, it would improve its chances to 26 percent, while simultaneously dropping Portland to virtually zero percent. A tie would actually be the &lt;em&gt;combined&lt;/em&gt; worst-case scenario for the two teams. They currently share 38-percent chances at the overall top seed, but a tie would leave the Sounders at 12.4 percent and the Timbers with 0.3 percent, allowing New York (45.3%) and Sporting Kansas City (42.8%) to fight over the Shield. These two teams are almost sure to make the playoffs, regardless of tonight’s outcome. But a top-seed and the prospect of home-field advantage in a potential MLS Cup Final no doubt elicits some drooling from both sets of supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m not really going to apologize for the biased topics. It’s very heavy Timbers/Sounders, which corresponds with the teams that we support, and we kind of neglect all else. The thing is this: despite there being 17 other teams in the league, this derby could also influence a lot of what’s going to happen to the rest of the Western Conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, that isn’t the whole narrative to the MLS playoffs, considering that there three-to-four clubs that could possibly swap in or out of the playoffs in the East. However, there just seemed to be a huge story line here to us, as well as some interesting numbers that correspond to it, which is why Timbers/Sounders became this week’s theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week we’ll return to taking a look at the rest of the league…mostly. I mean, I’m sure Sunday night’s game will come up, but there are other things to be mentioned and you’ll hear less of our bias. But, as it has been mentioned previously, bias accounts for a lot when dealing with numbers, and it only seems appropriate that it would also be present in what we do in regards to our podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, well. Here it is, and I hope you like it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>North American Soccer League and its 2013 First Half</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/north-american-soccer-league-and-its-2013-first-half/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last 12 months have been rather eventful for the North American Soccer League (NASL). A league that once folded before some of us were born has begun to become some what relevant again. Even putting aside the excitement surrounding the return of the New York Cosmos to professional soccer—-a team that is surrounded and entrenched in US Soccer history—-one sees how well the league fared against some of the MLS clubs. NASL knocked out two of the big dogs in the LA Galaxy (2-0, Carolina RailHawks) and Seattle Sounders FC (1-0, Tampa Bay Rowdies) this past year. Add that to the expansion plans of the league outside of New York. This past year they’ve added Indianapolis, Jacksonville and Oklahoma City to their growing portfolio. These were shrewd moves to get toe holds in two cities that have limited professional sports and strengthen their ties in Florida, what with three soccer cities in South Florida and four in the Southeastern region. The league is obviously poised for a positive return. Living in Tampa for the next few months, I plan on taking in at least one match (this weekend in their Derby game vs. Fort Lauderdale) and checking out the scene. Okay, there is the narrative. Let’s take a look at the table and some numbers: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;shot-info&quot;&gt;Shot info&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/nasl2.png&quot; alt=&quot;NASL2&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;advanced-shot-info&quot;&gt;Advanced Shot Info&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/nasl.png?w=740&quot; alt=&quot;NASL&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;table-data&quot;&gt;Table Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/nasl1.png&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/nasl1.png?w=628&quot; alt=&quot;NASL1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, my new friends here in Tampa won’t like this very much but Fort Lauderdale should have finished much higher in the table. The disparity in the table between Minnesota and the Strikers is amazing considering the shot data. Though, between expected points and PDO, maybe United FC finished about where they should expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is surprisingly a lot of data in these supplied match reports. I know it may not seem like it, but there is. The time stamped shots can give us a bit more insight to the context of the shots. While we still can’t get to know some of the players (outside of the goal scorers) as well, it helps us get to know the teams as a whole within that league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can say what you want, but I love the idea of NASL growing and becoming legit competition with MLS. I love USL, NASL and MLS playing in the Open Cup, and I love seeing the sport grow in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll continue to throw NASL data out as I collect it. With my new city having an NASL team and a derby game this weekend, I thought it a great time to put this stuff out there. Now talk among yourselves…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A few key games this week...</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/a-few-key-games-this-week/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since we now have playoff and Supporters’ Shield chances on the site, it provides us with a means of weighting each upcoming game by its effect on playoff odds. What if, for instance, Montreal were to lose to New England at home this weekend? There’s no doubt it would hurt Montreal and keep New England alive, but just how much would it matter? The same question can be asked of the San Jose and Colorado, who play tonight. Currently, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/&quot;&gt;our model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; gives Colorado and Montreal 90.4 and 82.8 percent chances,&lt;em&gt; respectively, to make the playoffs, while San Jose and New England sit at 6.0 and 14.1 percent. Remember that our playoff chances refer to earning at least fifth place in the conference, and they do not include probability associated with ties for fifth. I re-ran our simulations three times, accounting for the three possible conclusions to each of those games. I allowed the simulator to pick winners as usual for the other matches this week and beyond. To the results! A San Jose tie or loss at home tonight would effectively end its chances of a playoff berth. In just 11 of the 10,000 simulated seasons (0.11%) did San Jose recover from a loss to claim a playoff spot (not counting ties for fifth), and even a tie only doubled those chances to about 0.23 percent. A win boosted its playoff chances from 6.0 to 12.0 percent. Playoffs would still not be likely for the Earthquakes, but at least a win tonight would give them something to play for in the final two games. Their opponent, Colorado, is the West’s most likely team to give up its playoff spot, according to our model. That said, its playoff chances are still quite high. Even a loss to San Jose tonight would only lower the Rapids’ playoff chances to about 78.4 percent. A tie or win for Colorado tonight essentially assures it a tie-breaker-free route to the playoffs with at least 98.7 percent probability (99.9% with a win tonight). Moving over to the East, the game most likely to swing playoff percentage points around is the Montreal—-New England matchup. New England could increase its playoff chances from 14.1 to nearly 39 percent with a road win. However, like San Jose, a tie or loss would hurt New England a lot. A tie would leave New England with only about a 5.6 percent shot at the playoffs, and a loss would render the Revs’ situation quite hopeless at 1.6 percent. Conversely, a win or tie for the Montreal Impact would have a mirrored result, boosting its playoff chances to 91.0 percent with a tie and 99.2 percent with win against the Revs. Like Colorado, a loss would not ruin Montreal, and their playoff chances would sit right around 63.3 percent. A lot of playoff probability is waiting to swing—-as much as 12 percent in San Jose’s case and 38 percent in New England’s case. In my opinion, this speaks as much to the weight resting on these final few weeks as it does to the weight that was on the games that led us to this point. Teams like Colorado and Montreal have performed well enough in the first 30 or 31 games to put themselves in a position where a loss still leaves them with better than 50 percent chances at a playoff spot. Oh, in case your were curious, our model gives San Jose a 39-percent shot at a win tonight, 31-percent chances of a loss, and 30-percent chances of a tie. As for New England, those probabilities are 29 percent, 39 percent and 32 percent. _&lt;/em&gt;The margins of error for 95% confidence are, at most, 1.0 percent for each playoff percentage calculation._&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a long one folks; the running time is roughly 75 minutes. We usually try to keep everything around an hour, but it’s been a while since all three of us were together. There may have been some moments we got a little excited and went longer than normal. This week’s first segment was an ode to &lt;strong&gt;Ben Olsen&lt;/strong&gt; and the&lt;strong&gt; DC United&lt;/strong&gt; game plan that not only produced a win on the road against a very tough opponent, but also won them the US Open Cup and a bid to the CONCACAF Champions League. Because the first segment went a bit long we used the second segment to cover the usual past week of matches, with emphasis on the following games: Sporting-Philly, New England-Houston, LA-Portland and Seattle-New York, all of which had significant impacts on the playoff outlook. The last segment saw us go into a bit of detail about Sporting Kansas City and a possible run at the MLS Cup. In our language, possible doesn’t always mean probable, but in this case it just might. There is also a the a spot where I completely butcher Matthias’ twitter handle, and I may have also made up a some words in there, too, only to have Drew coyly call me on it. All in all, this was was an especially fun episode to record, and I hope that you all enjoy it!

      <title>D.C. United and Waiting Until Next Year</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/dc-united-and-waiting-until-next-year-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Wait until next year” is about to become the mantra for 9 clubs as the MLS playoffs will be kicking off soon. It will leave those clubs behind, along with two more after the play-in round between the 4 &amp;amp; 5 seeds from the East and West, respectively. DC United, despite their US Open Cup victory, are the first of these nine to consider life after the season. With their lack of success this season, much of the discussion following their Open Cup win has been about how good they can be next year, regardless of what they did this season. This seems like a good question, but I decided to open it up a bit. How good have teams been following a season with a bottom-3 finish in the table? &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/last3finish1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Last3Finish&quot;&gt;One thing that easily catches one’s eye is that there are some repeats on here, which brings sustainability into question, but that’s a question for another day. What is important to me now is how massive 8 points is when you are talking about a table that is rich in parity. Bottom dwellers tended to perform about 8 points better in the tables the following season. Right now, 8 points separates the Chicago Fire from being out of the playoffs with a bottom-three finish in the Eastern Conference and a second-place finish. 8 points means a lot! While 8 points isn’t enough to completely change the fortunes DCU this off-season, it’s reasonable to expect a better-than-8-point improvement, due to some obvious roster turnover, health being restored to key figures in their best XI, and some added cap flexibility. You can point back to the 2009 New York Red Bulls or even the 2010 Philadelphia Union who both made substantial changes to put them in the playoff picture. Bottom line: if you think that D.C. United will be terrible next year because they were terrible this year, then you are wrong and getting ahead of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Champions League: How Much is it Worth to an MLS Club?</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/champions-league-how-much-is-it-worth-to-an-mls-club/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The major talking point concerning the CONCACAF Champions League, and gaining entry into the tournament, is the payroll increase that MLS affords a club that qualifies. Now, this isn’t the sizable increase for a club that we see for a team in Europe, but it has the potential to be a game-changer in MLS, depending on the team and its ownership. Most figures concerning team salary/payroll are generally guarded for obvious reasons. However, rather than using official numbers, I went through the data generously provided by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mlsplayers.org/salary_info.html&quot;&gt;Players Union&lt;/a&gt; and calculated the accrued difference in pay between when the team won entry and the following year after the increase. Now, as it happens, the Union only has data posted as far back as 2007, that’s okay. Since the tournament underwent changes, adapting to it’s current format back in 2008. [caption id=”attachment_730” align=”aligncenter” width=”401”]&lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/championsleagueincrease.png&quot; alt=&quot;ChampionsLeagueIncrease&quot;&gt; Figures above in millions of American dollars.[/caption] Obviously, this is still a small sample size, but it gives you a rough figure on how this could help DC United and the other Champion-League-bound clubs this season.  A big caveat to using the Unions’ data is that its just a snap shot at a given point in the season. Not necessarily what they paid out in dues for the entire campaign. An obvious tip-off to that is Seattle dropping payroll from 2009 to 2010. They didn’t cut funds, but because late in the season they traded away Freddie Ljungberg to Chicago, his cost was associated with their club despite Seattle playing the majority of his contract for the season. This is just one example among 20 unique situations. No season is the same. The LA Galaxy and their 16% cut in 2011 largely came from David Beckham’s greatly reduced fee. 2013 comes and that fee is entirely off the book with his trip to PSG and the Galaxy not replacing his huge contract with another high paid designated player. Instead they signed Omar Gonzalez. Still a team gaining access to the Champions League enjoys a nice 9% raise in their annual spending, and as is the case in other leagues, dollars spent correlate to points and position in the table to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MLS Playoff Chances</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/mls-playoff-chances/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are now including playoffs and Supporters’ Shield probabilities on &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/&quot;&gt;our MLS Tables&lt;/a&gt;, if you were unaware. These chances are calculated based on each team’s current points and remaining schedule. The remaining game-by-game probabilities are specifically generated from the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which team is playing at home. Home teams have won nearly 50% of all MLS matches during the last three seasons. There is definitely an advantage to having a remaining schedule packed with home matches. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total attempts generated and conceded. All season I have been studying the best predictive measures, and all season it’s been SHOTS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finishing rates for and against. Though finishing rates weren’t very predictive at the season’s midpoint, it turns out they’re not completely worthless after at least 25 games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Past strength of schedule, as measured by past opponents’ attempts data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other variables, such as past possession percentage, were considered, but they did not help predict the outcome of the game better than those chosen above.
The above indicators were tested on the last 10 week’s worth of games during the 2011, 2012 and 2013 seasons (well, up through the most recent week). Using a multinomial regression, I was able to calculate the influence of each indicator, and then the resulting probabilities of each of the three possible outcomes (home win, draw, away win). Once these probabilities were established, it was a matter of simulation. My simulation was based on the game-by-game probabilities (above), and I let the computer simulate the games as though they were weighted coin flips (like how your PS3 simulates Fifa or Madden games) over and over again. So basically, I simulated the last 36 games of the season 10,000 times each, added up the total points for each team, and created 10,000 simulated tables. The POFF% probabilities is simply the proportion of times that each team earned a “clean” playoff berth—-that is, ties for fifth were not included. The Shield% probability represents the proportion of times each team earned at least a share of the top position in MLS. As an example, Portland made the playoffs 9,919 times out of the 10,000 simulated seasons, seeing its simulated probability of making the playoffs go up about 4.7% from last week after a win against the Galaxy. What might surprise you a little is that the Timbers have a very real chance (16.3%) at the Supporters’ Shield, according to this model. That’s up about 10% from last week. To try to understand why Portland received such a favorable jump, consider that just about every possible thing that could have helped the Timbers’ chances happened. Portland earned 3 points against a team that the model thought was pretty good (the Galaxy), Seattle and New York tied—-the best possible outcome from Portland’s perspective—-and Sporting KC lost in a pretty big upset. Though RSL still won, that doesn’t matter too much because Portland gets RSL at home, and that match will be the one that most likely determines a points winner between the two teams. Also consider that Portland has a home match against Seattle coming up. Because the model gives big boosts to home teams, the Timbers have a reasonable chance for 6-point swings against RSL and Seattle. Oh, and there’s that away match at Chivas to end the season. The model thinks Portland will take three points in that one with about 50% probability,&lt;em&gt; which is quite high for any away team. There is still a lot of fight left in the Eastern Conference playoff push, as four teams have less than 60% probability of making the playoffs. In the West, things are a little more straightforward, though San Jose has been sneaky of late, and it could potentially steal Colorado’s playoff spot. The model seems to like the Galaxy’s talent and schedule more than Colorado, enough to put the Rapids on the Western Conference’s hot seat. _&lt;/em&gt;That might seem low, but consider that Chivas has 5 wins, 7 losses and 4 draws at home this season. That means they have only lost 7/16 games at home, or about 44%. Portland’s 50.3% makes more sense in that context._&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our most recent episode finds Drew and I doing a review of the MLS table, a US Open Cup preview and a short look at the weeks Champion League results. We transition to a discussion about the rebuilding of Toronto FC and then a playoff preview of Real Salt Lake. I hope you enjoy it.

      <title>How Much Difference Did Kei Kamara Make To Sporting Kansas City?</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent some time this week riding a few planes and doing my cross-country travel thing with the family. That means a lot of distractions, which in turn leads to time reading nerdy books and listening to podcasts. I’m not sure if it was just that the Sporting KC machine was on full crisis mode or what. I happened to catch 4 different podcasts (including &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/09/19/analysis-evolved-podcast-episode-xxii-a-treatise-on-podcasting-casual-wear-rbny-and-the-mls-playoffs/&quot;&gt;our own&lt;/a&gt;…btw what a job Drew &amp;amp; Matty did without me, huh? Proves I’m expendable…)  talking about Sporting and their lack of ability to facilitate a goal in the Champions League at home. Obviously that’s a big deal, in part because they look to be one of the teams that will proceed on to the quarter finals next spring and continue to represent MLS. But despite them sitting pretty in the CCL and third (using points per game) in the table for the Supporter Shield, a couple of podcasts basically forecasted that they would fall a part without a “proven scorer” now that &lt;strong&gt;Kei Kamara&lt;/strong&gt; has departed. Now, I have to say that I’ve been mildly impressed with them as a team, and their pack of forwards—-featuring &lt;strong&gt;Claudio Bieler&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Soony Saad&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;CJ Sapong&lt;/strong&gt; and the recently returned &lt;strong&gt;Dominic Dwyer—-&lt;/strong&gt;make for an interesting four-some. That isn’t including &lt;strong&gt;Teal Bunbury&lt;/strong&gt; who made his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kansascity.com/2013/06/12/4289888/teal-bunbury-makes-his-return.html&quot;&gt;return to the club after being out for a year-long rehab with a torn ACL&lt;/a&gt;. My immediate reaction two weeks ago was to question the transfer the deadline deal and transfer of Kamara three weeks ago. I spent a day putting some thoughts together and then second-guessed myself that I was maybe naive. They’ve got quite a few weapons, and the added play of &lt;strong&gt;Benny Feilhaber—-&lt;/strong&gt;who admittedly I’ve never been a fan of—-stepping into the void left by the departure of a six-foot, three-inch winger from Sierra Leone has been big. Their string of results (9 points in 3 games) made me think I was being silly. Then today, while on the road from Atlanta, a thought crossed my mind and I decided that I would take a closer look at the numbers. I collected shot data for the matches Kamara participated in (and to the minute he was subbed in) as well as the games Sporting played without him, and I built myself a nifty little spreadsheet. Now, before I throw these numbers at you, there is the need for a little asterisk to all this work. I’m sure it’s already understood, but if not, let me make it clear: these numbers are very vague and there is still quiet a bit of noise involved. How much, I’m not sure. It’s just important to recognize the difficulty of trying to measure what a team does with and without a single player, and extract the difference. I would love to quantify everything, but &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is currently unavailable. This is a very simple method in a very small sample size of a context. To the numbers! With Kei Kamara… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Minutes
1026&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHOT RATIO
2.171&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KP RATIO
1.940&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals per 90
1.930&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals Allowed per 90
1.316&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Points Per Match
1.67
And then again… only without him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without Kamara&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Minutes
1584&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHOT RATIO
1.527&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KP RATIO
1.793&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals per 90
1.193&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals Allowed per 90
0.739&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Points Per Match
1.63
You can see pretty the numbers plainly that the are overwhelmingly in the favor of Sporting being a better team with Kamara. And I don’t think anyone would argue against it. However, the difference between the two teams should be questioned as it’s possible the numbers are a result of the different system in which coach &lt;strong&gt;Peter Vermes&lt;/strong&gt; implements with Kamara opposed to how he configures the team without his former star forward. I think the big stat that stands out to me is the number of goals allowed per 90 without Kamara in the starting XI. Which is pretty crazy, considering that the club actually surrenders less shots with Kamara in the line-up: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.7 with vs. 7.4 without.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; This is what leads me to believe that A) the team plays a different style without him and B) that it may not be sustainable. I wasn’t on the crazy train with thinking that Sporting has all these problems and is going to eventually fall apart. I’m still cautious enough that I’m still waiting to see if they’ll make a move towards the Supporters Shield with their remaining 5 matches in the season. Their shot ratio, even without Kamara, would still be best in all of MLS. So it’s hard to simply throw crazy statements that this team is that much worse without him. The bigger issue at hand for me is that Sporting was a force with Kamara. Without him, they’re simply another good team in league filled with good teams. Both are sets of clubs (with and without Kamara) that are capable of winning silverware. That said, this really leads you to question why Vermes would sell off such a significant difference-maker overseas with a real shot at making a run for multiple cups at this point in the season.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was suppose to be a quick 15-to-20-minute podcast that turned into an almost 52-minute single segment ramble about all things US in the past week. It was just Drew and I, covering just about everything conceivable over the course of the loss to Costa Rica on the road to the win in Columbus against Mexico. No spoilers; just have a listen. [audio &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/asa-episode-xxi.mp3&quot;&gt;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/asa-episode-xxi.mp3&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;em&gt;*Editors note:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Matthias to Drew by text after CR’s second goal: [Howard didn’t look ready for that one. I think he could have done more.]&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Matthias to Drew by text after CR’s third goal: [The defender definitely got beat, but the Costa Rican player didn’t even get to the ball until it was 23 yards out. That’s Howard’s ball. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Drew on Podcast: “…and Matthias was texting me…Matthias was like ‘what’s he doing in there? These goals are all his fault.’ “&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In a private interview with the Matthias, the editor was assured that Matthias never thought the goals were 100% Howard’s fault, as Matthias—-a student of probability—-rarely believes anything is 100%.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Oh, and Drew is a poophead. &lt;/em&gt;   &lt;em&gt;**Editors note part 2:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Matthias edited is the editor of the site, just in case you didn’t realize that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Colorado's Playoff Chances.</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/colorados-playoff-chances/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few short months ago, we recorded &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/06/01/mls-soccer-podcast/&quot;&gt;a podcast&lt;/a&gt; in which we discussed the teams likely to make the playoffs in the Western Conference. At the time, we did not think Colorado would get in, but now—-after a surprising win in Los Angeles—-the Rapids find themselves very much in the thick of the playoff race. As of May 31st, Colorado had earned 19 points from 13 games and sat in 5th place out west. Additionally, the Rapids’ 1.03 attempts ratio was 6th in the conference, while our shot locations data suggested an expected goal differential essentially tied for 4th. Perhaps we shouldn’t have discarded them so quickly. Now with more information, we’ve seen how shot ratios help to predict the future as well as anything in soccer. The predictions aren’t awesome, but better than if we were to use goal differential or standings. Colorado has found itself &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;still&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in playoff contention, and I think it is worth revisiting the playoff chances for the Western Conference’s mile-high team. Now, 28 weeks into the season, Colorado has improved its shots ratios and expected goal differential to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;second in the conference&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, just behind the Galaxy on both accounts. But while Colorado could very well be one of the top teams in the West, its remaining schedule is pretty brutal. Of its last six matches, five of them come against Dallas, Portland, San Jose and Vancouver (twice). Those are the four teams fighting along with the Rapids for the final two playoff spots. The other game on their schedule just so happens to be Seattle, the current favorite to win the Supporters’ Shield. There is not a single cupcake on the schedule, and losses will be far more costly than if they were against Eastern Conference foes. While the best predictions using shots data still leaves much to be desired, that data would in fact pick Colorado as the second best team in the West. However, playing a tough schedule against opponents shooting for the same playoff spot, there is so much weight on just a few games. I’d pick Colorado to be one of those top five in the tables at the end, but it’s not a gimme pick. Let’s say, ooooh, 55%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moved days! We’ll be getting the podcast to you Thursday night/Friday morning from here on out. You know, rather than getting it to you on Sunday after all the weekends games have been played. If nothing else, it should give you something great* to hear on your way to the match. This episode, we devote our second segment to talking about the MLS Front offices and geeks vs. nerds, and then we also touch on women in the front office as well as in the coaches’ boxes. Among other things we play a couple of silly games and then, of course, talk random news and notes for the past week. Hope you enjoy!

      <title>A Short Exercise in the Power of a Player: Mike Magee and Juan Agudelo Observed</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/mike-magee-juan-agudelo-power-of-one-player/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I asked the question on Twitter, “how many teams have been better than Chicago since the arrival of Mike Magee?” Let’s take a look at the results of games played since the acquisition of Magee on May 24th. &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/ppg-sincemay24.png&quot; alt=&quot;PPG-sinceMay24&quot;&gt; I think we knew that the Fire have been good since the arrival of Magee, but just how good is pretty surprising. Adding to the surprise are both the Whitecaps and Revolution with 1.6 points per game.  Looking to the bottom of the table we see how far FC Dallas has dropped since their hot start to the season. I know that we all like to think that the results in March and April are vital, and to a degree they are—-there is no way that FC Dallas is even considering a run at the playoffs if it wasn’t for how they performed in Mar/Apr—-however, the season is long; there are nearly 8 months and 34 games. &lt;a href=&quot;http://prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com/2013/09/03/a-reduced-28-game-mls-season-may-be-around-the-corner/&quot;&gt;For now anyway…&lt;/a&gt; I’ve long been of the belief that one player in soccer doesn’t make that big of a difference on an entire season and it’s table location. Sure, maybe Clint Dempsey takes Seattle from being an injury prone playoff-ish team to a contender for the Supporters Shield. But Chicago was, and is now, much better. Along with Chicago, New England’s performance needs mention too. Currently, the minute men have 17 points through 8 matches with Juan Agudelo in the line-up. Something pointed out to me by the folks over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DeepInTheFort&quot;&gt;Deep in the Fort&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s also a conclusion that makes me question how much that’s true and how much a really good player can impact a season for a club. Obviously it needs a much closer observance than a single table of points over a time period. There are other factors to consider with both clubs. Regression, sample size, ect. But there is enough there to at least consider further research into the thought that some players can mean big things for the right club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/mike-magee-juan-agudelo-power-of-one-player/#84&quot; title=&quot;2013-09-06 15:46:44&quot;&gt;Matthias Kullowatz&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; You know what Matty wants to know, right? What about their shot rates??!! #shotnerd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/mike-magee-juan-agudelo-power-of-one-player/#86&quot; title=&quot;2013-09-06 23:08:10&quot;&gt;Harrison Crow&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This is not about a predictive measurement. However, a short synopsis of how much they are responsible for the shots and the creation of shots and/or goals for their respective clubs would be pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The General Manager Position in MLS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During tonight’s podcast we will be talking a bit about the constructs of MLS offices. It’s easy to question the thinking behind transactions and player dealings. Each person has a specific idea behind the move and their own end game and plan that they wish to execute.  Personnel decision making is an important skill. We can find out more about some of the these skills if we actually know the individuals behind the desk of their respective clubs. This list is far from exhaustive. The effort is to give a single point of reference for front office types in each MLS club. The problem behind this little pilot study is that not all them are singularly responsible for the decision making as there are others: CEOs, CFOs, Presidents and a myriad of others that help influence these decisions. That said this is a good start to getting an idea as to who is pulling some of the strings when it comes to putting together the 30-man roster and dealing with the salary cap. The list is sorted according to the current (9/4) Supporter Shield standings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, the three names that stand out to me are (maybe, unsurprisingly) &lt;strong&gt;Adrian Hanauer&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Rob Vartughian&lt;/strong&gt; and Javier Leon (though admittedly there isn’t much on him). The three men are the only three to not have played professionally at any level. Something to think about and consider with these hirings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Park Effects: How does this apply in MLS?</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/mls-park-factors/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30  Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/mls-park-factors/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This sparked my curiosity the other day. Joe Posnanski, who is an amazing baseball writer, wrote about the current MVP race as the MLB season dwindles down. One of his &lt;a href=&quot;http://joeposnanski.blogspot.com/2013/08/explaining-cabrera-trout-and-war.html&quot;&gt;large points is, of course, offensive production&lt;/a&gt; and how you properly place that into context. He mentions something about park factors between the two hitters in the race, young stud Mike Trout and hall-of-fame surefire Miguel Cabrera. As usual, this discussion of value in baseball spawned chaos in the comments section and lead to a follow-up article. JoePo breaks down park factors crudely but effectively in stating the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the BASICS of Park Factors are the easiest thing imaginable. All you do is this: Step one: You take the average runs scored in a ballpark (both teams). Step two: You take the average runs scored in that team’s road games (both teams). Step three: You divide the first total by the second. And that’s all. Park Factors. There is so much contentiousness about Comerica Park but it’s all simple math. This year, the Tigers have scored 355 runs at Comerica and allowed 275 runs. That’s a total of 630 runs in 67 games — 9.4 runs per game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this was brought to my attention by &lt;a href=&quot;http://tangotiger.com/index.php/site/comments/how-to-calculate-park-factors-by-poz?utm_medium=twitter&amp;amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&quot;&gt;Tom Tango and his mention on his blog&lt;/a&gt;. Tango also gives some brief qualifiers that are specific to baseball, as well as mentioning the uncertainty of the exact degree that it affects the race. It’s some great stuff for baseball. It made me start wondering about park conditions in MLS. It’s obvious that pitches play differently and that they come in different shapes and sizes. This can be done a multitude of ways as mention by Poz and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseball-reference.com/about/parkadjust.shtml&quot;&gt;described by Basellball-Reference&lt;/a&gt;. It’s already been covered one way by &lt;a href=&quot;http://tempofreesoccer.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Alex Olshansky of Tempo-Free Soccer&lt;/a&gt; in an article for StatsBomb a month ago. However, Alex used Goal differential. Which is fine, if we’re strictly speaking about an individual park leading to more goals, not necessarily home field advantage. I wrote an article just a month ago about &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/08/01/mls-home-field-advantage-and-success-rates/&quot;&gt;home field advantage&lt;/a&gt; working off percentage of points won at home versus total points. Regardless, you can see most teams seem have an advantage playing at home. But I’m interested in how many of these home locations either increase limit or increase shots/goal opportunities. Is there a place in MLS that, due to the dimensions or the crowd or some other outside reason, it is better to be a striker versus a defender? That it limits or maybe creates more goal scoring opportunities? It’s an interesting question for certain and maybe not even one to limit to goals. Maybe we could open it up to turnovers, as that might give us some indication of the quality of the pitch. These are just some thoughts on a Friday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I was asked simply, which team has the best pairing in MLS? It’s a good question, and oddly one that I’ve been asked a lot and. Despite the frequency of requests, it’s something that I have trouble answering. There are a lot of ways to measure performance for attacking personnel, but due to my time restraints I found the easiest way to do this was to go to Squawka and use their attack score. Below is a listing of teams and their two highest&lt;em&gt; attacking score combos. Since it’s a purely cumulative stat I pro-rated it to 90 minutes. As you probably wouldn’t be shocked to find out. &lt;strong&gt;Mike Magee&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Landon Donovan&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;*Federico Hinguian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; round out the top-3. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Chicago Fire and Goal Mouth Data</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/the-chicago-fire-and-goal-mouth-data/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28  Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/the-chicago-fire-and-goal-mouth-data/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is merely a trial run. I say that because in the last two days I’ve limited the collection of data and then expanded it. It comes down to how it tickles my fancy. The data I have collected is limited for the time being to the Chicago Fire as just a means of comparing a club and its data to the league and trying to make sense of it. This hopefully will develop into the means of how I can some how attribute value to clubs and their keepers in the future. Below is a picture of the goal mouth, and the data has been collected from the website Sqwuaka.com. Coupled with a previously built image, you can see how Chicago compares to the rest of the league and how a majority of their goals have been scored this season. While numbers are always an important thing, remember that it’s more about ratios and the average occurrence than pure accumulation at this juncture. Not all teams have played the same amount of games and they haven’t had the same opportunities.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/shotsgoals-and-visuals1.png?w=890&quot; alt=&quot;Shots+Goals and visuals&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/chicagofirehud.png?w=890&quot; alt=&quot;ChicagoFireHUD&quot;&gt; In addition to the Goal Mouth visual, here is a field map diagram as it applies to the dimension of the field. This has already been provided in raw form in the data that Matty has collected and posted in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/shot-locations/team-by-team-shot-locations/&quot;&gt;raw shot data&lt;/a&gt; tab, but I wanted to have another visual to compare the above data. &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/chicagofire-shotfield.png?w=609&quot; alt=&quot;ChicagoFire-ShotField&quot;&gt; The problem between the two is that there is no correlation between the fact that Chicago has allowed 4 goals in section 5 to the fact that they’ve also allowed 5 goals in SoT1 (for ease of the tally, I gave a numerical designation to each location on the goal mouth; starting at the top and working left to right). This is the next collaborative effort that I’m working on, gathering both the shot location of origin and placement on the goal, and from what specific individual at what time. This is a very time-intensive task and it’ll probably take me the rest of the week to complete it just for Chicago. However, I’m taking suggestions on how I could compile this data without hand jamming it into a flat file. An SQL dump of the current Opta database for the season would go a long ways to helping compile this data and would be nice. But I’m never above a bit of hard work. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Visual Look At Shots On Target</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/mls-shots-on-target/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part of my efforts to try to come up with a zone rating of sorts for goal keepers. The problem I’m running into at the moment is trying to find visual information for shots against. If I want to know how good Dan Kennedy was preventing goals against Columbus in week 1, I have to go to Columbus’ page on Squawka and narrow the shot data to that specific game. Basically, It just boils down to more time digging than I initially planned to devote. Quickly, here is a visual graphic that I made with the help of Excel. I know it’s not really pretty, but it delivers the data in the manner in which I needed it without getting caught up on eccentric details, details with which I often spend too much time meddling. &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/shotsgoals-and-visuals1.png?w=890&quot; alt=&quot;Shots+Goals and visuals&quot;&gt; There isn’t a lot that this immediately tells you, of course. It’s more of a jumping off point to start comparing data once it is collected. That’s where the next effort is going to be headed. Who are the teams that are above league average and below league average? Are they bleeding low percentage goals, or are they being beat in an unusual zone? This information, while still miles from being complete, moves us in the right direction of knowing more about shots and goals than what we did previously. You’ll notice that I also included shots that are wide but still close to the post. I’m curious as to whether these shots numbers become inflated when playing teams with “better keepers”. Unfortunately we need to define what better is. Better than what, exactly? I’m not sure. Again, parameters haven’t been set, and data sets are still being gathered. This is a fun exercise and one that should, if nothing else, provide us with some excellent insight to teams and their seasons at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so Drew came up lame with a sore throat, leaving Matty and I to fend for ourselves and sending the podcast into a downward dive/30-minute discussion about Landon Donovan. We follow that up with another 30-minute discussion about the CONCACAF Champions League (CCL). At some point, in perhaps a show of solidarity or more likely a show of that pessimism that could come only from a couple of Mariners fans, we projected good things for each other’s club. I for Portland, and Matty for Seattle. Despite advertising a 2nd segment as a discussion about MLS front office personnel decisions—-regarding past players and whether or not we’ll see any future Ivy League day traders being hired into technical director positions—-we had to cut the segment from the podcast due to mass overages in the first segment. We hope to pick up the nerds-vs.-jocks  talk next week. This is one of our longest running podcasts at 70 minutes, but it’s still a good one.  I hope you enjoy!

      <title>Comparing Goalkeepers to Pitchers</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/soccer-goal-keepers-baseball-pitchers/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25  Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/soccer-goal-keepers-baseball-pitchers/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cruising around twitter is about the most social I get nowadays. It sounds nerdy, and really it is, but it’s amazing the amount of material that you can discover—-not to mention the 140-character conversations you can have—-produced by people smarter than me. Looking around, I stumbled across an article that dates back about 10 days from the site ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://bringonthestats.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Bring On The Stats&lt;/a&gt;‘ by the anonymous author Chase H (aka @chaser_racer32 on twitter). Chase H, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bringonthestats.wordpress.com/2013/08/14/pitchers-vs-goalkeepers/&quot;&gt;goes into a good post&lt;/a&gt; about how Sporting Kansas City’s goal keeper,&lt;strong&gt; Jimmy Neilsen&lt;/strong&gt;, is—-probably gradually—-headed for the decline. He comes to this conclusion by going through save% and shots against per minute. A pretty good tactic that has some good reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The table above is sorted by save %, which is pretty self-explanatory; it’s the percentage of shots saved by the keeper. Nielsen has the third-worse save % of all goalkeepers with more than 1400 minutes played. The perfect example of why wins and shutouts are not the best measures for a goalkeeper is the fact that Chivas USA keeper Dan Kennedy has saved a higher percentage of shots than Nielsen, and yet has only recorded 2 shutouts, and the team only has 4 wins. Kennedy has the misfortune of playing for one of the worst teams in the MLS, and he has faced almost 50 more shots than Jimmy Nielsen. On the flip side, one can argue that because the defense plays so well, generally only the most quality shots make it on goal from the opponent. I do acknowledge that is a very big issue to this study, but to compare Neilsen’s stats from last season with the same defense, we see he saved 74% of the shots he faced while the defense conceded almost exactly the same numbers of shots per minute he played.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty sure I’ve seen the analogy of baseball pitchers compared to goal keepers before—-if not from some random person or thing I read, then certainly from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MattyAnselmo&quot;&gt;Matthias&lt;/a&gt;. The point of the comparison being that neither the goalkeeper nor the pitcher really has &lt;em&gt;as much&lt;/em&gt; influence on goals allowed or runs scored against them as a lot of traditionalists and general fans believe. In fact, baseball created an individual stat to track exactly what a pitcher controls, and Fangraphs grades him solely on that stat, “FIP.” The stat has been well-documented and was introduced to the general public by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fangraphs.com/library/pitching/fip/&quot;&gt;writers much more skilled than myself&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the early 2000s, research by Voros McCracken revealed that the amount of balls that fall in for hits against pitchers do not correlate well across seasons. In other words, pitchers have little control over balls in play. McCracken outlined a better way to assess a pitcher’s talent level by looking at results a pitcher _can _control: strikeouts, walks, hit by pitches, and homeruns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding some reading material on FIP today, and thinking about our podcast about the possibility of whether keepers influence shots on target, sparked some thoughts following the article by Chase H. The idea of keepers being analogous to pitchers is all well and good. There are certainly some similarities. The problem I’m starting to have, though, is that there may be a better way of looking at it. Pitchers, while minimally, still control aspects of their performance such as ground ball and fly ball rates, strikeouts and walks. Keepers potentially could influence opponents psychologically, but truly the only physical effect they have at their disposal, prior to the shot, is their positioning. Positioning frequently corresponds to the defensive placement of a keeper’s teammates and the opposition that controls possession. This isn’t the quiet like-to-like thinking that most jump into. However, I started reading about another baseball statistic and it made me think… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the differences between UZR and linear weights is that with UZR, the amount of credit that the fielder receives on each play—-positive (if he makes an out) or negative (if he allows a hit or an ROE)—-depends on how often that particular kind of batted ball, in terms of its location, speed and several other factors, is fielded by an average fielder at the same position. With offensive linear weights, if a batted ball is a hit or an out, the credit that the batter receives is not dependent on where or how hard the ball was hit, or any other parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe, we (and by we, I mean me) are looking at keepers the wrong way. Just like assuming that keepers have control over wins, shutouts and the like, is it any more responsible to assume that goals scored against them are purely their fault either? I’m talking about save percentage here. To test this Keeper UZR out, we need to create set of guidelines in the same manner as what has been set out for UZR. There is also the key dependency that we don’t have 6 years worth of data to work from. We barely have3 years of chalkboard data, and if using WhoScored or Squawka, we have even less than that. The other problem is that we don’t know the speed of the shot, and getting the angle of the shot isn’t necessarily easy either. Not that it’s particularly important. My goal this week is to take the shot data by Squawka and put together a visual representation of the six prominent scoring locations complete with shots saved data associated. &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/goalsscoredagainstssfc.png&quot; alt=&quot;goalsscoredagainstSSFC&quot;&gt; The first thing we need to establish is what are the areas shots are saved the least and how good keepers are at limiting goals they should. This seems rather silly, as I’m sure we can probably already theorize the likely goal-scoring locales as being the outside marks near the post. However, we still need numbers and we still need to know how good teams are at preventing goals that they often should. Controlling for difficulty of shot on target by location on the frame at least starts to give us an intelligent understanding of what goal keepers are doing right and what they are doing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Noisy Finishing Rates</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/noisy-finishing-rates/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a supplement to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/08/12/signal-and-noise-in-mls/&quot;&gt;stabilization analysis&lt;/a&gt; I did last week, I wanted to add the self-predictive powers of &lt;em&gt;finishing rates&lt;/em&gt;—basically soccer’s shooting percentage. Team finishing rates can be found both on our &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/&quot;&gt;MLS Tables&lt;/a&gt; and in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/shot-locations/&quot;&gt;Shot Locations&lt;/a&gt; analysis, so it would be nice to know if we can trust them. Last week I split the 2012 and 2013 seasons in half and assessed the simple linear relationships for various statistics between the two halves of each season across all 19 teams. Now I have 2011 data, and we can have even more fun. I included bivariate data from both 2011 and 2012 together, leaving out 2013 since it is not over yet. It is important to note that I am not looking &lt;em&gt;across&lt;/em&gt; seasons, only &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; seasons. To the results! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stat&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Correlation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pvalue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Points&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.438&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.7%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Attempts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.397&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.5%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blocked Shots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.372&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.3%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shots on Goal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.297&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7.4%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.261&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11.9%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shots off Goal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.144&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;39.5%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finishing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.109&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;52.1%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, to me at least, a team’s points earned has been the most stable statistic in MLS (by my linear definition of stability). Not so surprising to me was that total attempts is also one of the most stable. Look down at the very bottom, and you’ll find finishing rates. Check out the graph below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/finishing-rates-stabilization-2011-2012.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Finishing Rates Stabilization 2011-2012&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some teams finish really well early in the season, then flop. Others finish poorly, then turn it on. But there’s no obvious to pattern that would allow us to predict second-half finishing rates. In fact, the best prediction for any given team would be to suggest that they will regress to league average, which is exactly what our &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/shot-locations/#lucktable&quot;&gt;Luck Table&lt;/a&gt; does. It regresses all teams’ finishing rates in each zone back to league averages, then calculates an expected goal differential. On a side note, you might be asking yourself why I don’t just use points to predict points. Because this: while the correlation between first-half and second-half points is about 0.438, the correlation between first-half attempts ratios and second-half points is slightly stronger at 0.480. Also, in a multiple regression model where I let both first-half attempts ratio and first-half points duke it out, first-half attempts ratio edges out points for winner of the predictor trophy. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ASA Podcast XVIII: The One Where We Discuss Defense Influencing Shots</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Family in town, waiting out this baby and being home doing nothing sure has made me lazy. So lazy that I really didn’t get around to editing this and putting it together until last night. My apologies for the late posting. This week we discuss the USMNT and their romp in eastern Europe, a bit about Montreal and Omar Gonzalez. Then we transition to some discussion about whether goal keepers can influence shots on target. It’s all some interesting stuff with a lot of giggling by me because I coined a new nickname for Drew.

      <title>Signal and Noise in MLS</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/signal-and-noise-in-mls/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some Nate Silver guy wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4zhI9uLs4U&quot;&gt;whole book&lt;/a&gt; about “signal” and “noise” in data, so it must be important, right? Sports produce a lot of statistics, and it turns out that some of those statistics are pretty meaningless—-that is, pretty noisy. A pitcher’s ERA is sitting below 3.00 after eight starts, but he has more walks than strikeouts. Baseball sabermetricians will tell you that the low ERA is mostly noise, but that the high walk rate is a signal for impending doom. An MLS team leads the league in points per match, but it allows more shots than it earns for itself (note: this team is called “Montreal Impact”). Soccer nerds like me will tell you that its position in the standings is mostly noise, and that its low shots ratio is a signal for impending doom—-or something worse than first place, anyway. The reasoning behind both examples above is basically the same. Pitchers’ ERAs, like soccer teams’ points earned, are highly variable and unpredictable, while strikeout-to-walk ratios and shots ratios are more consistent. It’s better to put your money on something consistent and easy to predict, rather than something variable and hard to predict. Duh, right? So here’s why we like shots data ‘round these parts. Below I have provided two charts of MLS data, one from 2012 and one from 2013. I split each season into two parts and then measured the linear predictive power of each stat on itself. Did teams that scored lots of goals early in the season also score lots of goals later in the season? That’s the kind of question answered here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2012 MLS&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stat&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;R2&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pvalue&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2013 MLS&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stat&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;R2&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pvalue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blocked Shots
37.1%
0.6%
Shots off Goal
34.8%
0.8%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Attempts
26.1%
2.5%
Total Attempts
34.5%
0.8%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals
20.3%
5.3%
Shots on Goal
29.4%
1.7%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Points
20.1%
5.5%
Points
4.1%
40.7%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shots on Goal
18.2%
6.9%
Blocked Shots
1.7%
60.0%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shots off Goal
3.6%
43.7%
Goals
1.5%
61.6%
As an example of what this means, let’s consider the attempts stat. Remember that an attempt is any effort in the direction of the goal, so basically an attempt is any shot—-on target, off target, or blocked. In each of the past two seasons, MLS teams’ attempts totals in the first half of the season were able to help predict their attempts totals in the second half, explaining 26.1% and 34.5% of the variability in second-half attempts, respectively. Those might not seem like high percentages of explanation, but the MLS season is short, and statistically significant predictors are hard to find. In baseball, such “self-predictors” have been referred to as “stabilization.” Stabilization is important because, as mentioned above, stabilization means that a stat is consistent, and that a team is likely to replicate its results in the future. This MLS season, points earned during the first 10 matches were essentially worthless at predicting points earned in the second 10 games. Even over the 34 games each team played in 2012, the stabilization for points earned was not as strong as that of attempts or goals scored.* The next step is figuring out what predicts future points earned, since it does a pretty lame job of predicting itself. But I’ll leave that for another post after I have gathered data going back a few more seasons. The number one takeaway here is that some stats can only tell us what happened, but not what will happen. There is another group of stats that are doubly important because they also stabilize—-predicting themselves using smaller sample sizes. Those stabilizing stats (like shot attempts) are the signal amid the sea of noise known most places as “football.” &lt;em&gt;Seattle has only played 21 games, so I cannot do 11-and-11 splits, yet.  Also, as for why shots off goal and blocked shots have essentially switched places, I would wager that’s more due to how they are (somewhat) subjectively categorized, but who knows. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Game of the Week: Montreal Impact at Chicago Fire</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/game-of-the-week-montreal-impact-chicago-fire/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So why this game, you ask. Real Salt Lake is hosting Houston, and the Revs travel to play the Wiz, but I picked this game instead. Despite a negative goal differential, I like Chicago in this one. I smell upset. Our &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/&quot;&gt;MLS tables&lt;/a&gt; tell me that Chicago ranks 5th in the league in attempts ratio at 1.07, earning nearly 10% more shot attempts than its opponents on average. When we account for where those shots are coming from, our &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/shot-locations/&quot;&gt;shot location data&lt;/a&gt; suggests that Chicago’s goal differential should be pretty even: -0.04 expected goal differential (xGD) per game if I regress finishing rates 100%. Basically Chicago is an average team with a little bad own-goals luck. However, as I’ve been preaching all year, Montreal’s play is seemingly unsustainable, and it is playing on the road. Despite the most points per game in MLS, Montreal owns the third-worst attempts ratio in the league, and an expected goal differential of -0.20 goals per game. The Impact may very well be the second-best team on the pitch come Saturday. &lt;strong&gt;Chicago Fire Shots Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week we welcome Chris Gluck as our first guest on the podcast. We talk possession, basic attacking principles and stats. Later on we mention #DempseyWatch. I talk about it from a Seattle perspective, discussing how the team could afford to make him the richest player in MLS history. We also talk a little Gold Cup final recap, and we wrap up the final segment with some Marrying, Boffing, and Killing of  Kris Boyd. Enjoy!

      <title>MLS, Home Field Advantage And Success Rates</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/mls-home-field-advantage-and-success-rates/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/07/28/asa-podcast-episode-15-the-one-where-we-talk-about-home-field-advantage/&quot;&gt;the podcast&lt;/a&gt; we talked a bit about home field advantage and the fact that it undeniably exists. But while it does exist, the question then becomes to what extent does it exist? What teams have taken advantage of it over the past few years? I went back as far as 2008 to collect some data. I’m not sure what this data all means, but I feel that it, at the very least, gives us a bit of commentary on those teams that had success and failure on their home pitches. I broke clubs into two groups: teams that scored more than 40 points and teams that scored less than 40 points. Then I compiled some key home stats for the two groups. A quick key for the stats used: &lt;strong&gt;%home won&lt;/strong&gt;, is the percentage of possible games at home at the team won. Duh, right? &lt;strong&gt;%home points&lt;/strong&gt; is the percentage of its home games in which the team nabbed &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; points (draw or win). &lt;strong&gt;%total of points&lt;/strong&gt; is how many points from home games contributed to their total points accrued over the season. Then &lt;strong&gt;GD&lt;/strong&gt; is just goal differential. &lt;/p&gt;

I wonder how much of that is that good teams are able to earn those three points, and how much of that is random. Kind of like the Baltimore Orioles last season winning all those one-run and extra-innings games, when most telling baseball statistics said they were probably a mediocre team. Just because you have a good record doesn’t mean you were a good team! I want shot ratios, Harrison! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Field Dimension, Turf and Home Field Advantage in MLS</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/07/28/asa-podcast-episode-15-the-one-where-we-talk-about-home-field-advantage/&quot;&gt;last weekend’s podcast&lt;/a&gt;, we discussed home field advantage and where it might come from. There is much literature to suggest that home field advantage comes largely from rowdy home crowds—crowds that both encourage the home team to be more aggressive and encourage the referees to be more biased—but you probably already presumed that. We went on to talk about “home specialists,” or teams that play especially well at home in a given season. An article on the site &lt;a href=&quot;http://thepowerofgoals.blogspot.com/2013/07/home-specialists-are-largely-random.html&quot;&gt;The Power of Goals&lt;/a&gt; theoretically explains why home specialists from any single season tend to be products of statistical noise rather than signal. That’s not to say there aren’t home specialists out there, only that it is nearly impossible to identify them statistically in a single season. Picking out the teams that have performed markedly better at home, and then retroactively seeking explanations to match the traits of those teams is known as cherry picking, and it’s likely to lead to false conclusions (On &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/07/28/asa-podcast-episode-15-the-one-where-we-talk-about-home-field-advantage/&quot;&gt;the podcast&lt;/a&gt;, I recounted an example from the book &lt;em&gt;Naked Statistics&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Wheelan as to why this can lead to trouble). Instead, identifying traits of teams and stadia first, and then checking for measurable differences in home performance based on those traits is a more sound approach. We have mentioned around here before that Houston’s narrow home pitch might have helped the Dynamo to one of the best home records since BBVA Compass Stadium was built in preparation for the 2012 season. Indeed, Houston’s field is the narrowest in the league at 70 yards, and the Dynamo’s home goal differential is a whopping 1.33 goals better at home than on the road. However, the only reason we considered field dimensions was because Houston has performed so well at home. We went like this: Extreme split for Houston —&amp;gt; Field Dimensions must matter But we should have thought like this: Field Dimensions —&amp;gt; Extreme splits? To advance the discussion, I gathered data going back to the 2010 season in order to look for explanatory patterns in two observable variables of stadia: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;field dimensions and surface&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. If teams are able to train on especially large or especially small fields, or on turf, such differences in the pitches may give home teams a leg up in matches played on those familiar pitches. It turns out there is not enough evidence that either turf surfaces or field dimensions have much to do with home success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/surface-vs-home-success1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Surface vs. Home success&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently four teams that play on turf: Portland, Seattle, Vancouver and New England. While the Timbers and Whitecaps have dominated at home, The Sounders and Revs have been sub par relative to the league in that department. Considering I didn’t account for the confounding variable that two of these teams play in front of some of the rowdiest fans in MLS, the “turf effect” may not even exist at all. It’s hard to say with only four teams playing on turf, three of which are not even in their adolescence as franchises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/width-vs-home-success.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Width vs. Home success&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field dimensions showed minimal effects, as well. Though Houston’s small, 70-by-115-yard pitch has correlated with its home success, that correlation is not true of other small stadia. The next-smallest stadium can be found in Washington D.C.,&lt;strong&gt; but DCU has actually performed a little worse at home relative to the typical league splits. Montreal has the widest pitch at 77 yards, and yet, also has performed well. There is a chance that teams with extreme widths—extremely narrow or extremely wide—have some sort of advantage, but we’re going to have to wait for additional data from Houston and Montreal to be more definitive about that. The vast majority of MLS pitches, 16-of-19 in fact, are either 74 or 75 yards wide. So even the two extremes in Houston and Montreal are not all that different. Houston could be a team built to play on a narrow pitch, but I’m skeptical that A) Soccer Analytics have come far enough for a general manager to sort that out and B) that 4-5 yards would make such a big difference. Though I can’t say for sure that the pitch effects are non-existent, I can say pretty confidently that they aren’t pronounced or noticeable in a single season. Right now, I would argue it’s more likely that Montreal and Houston have performed so well at home due to the random variation of only two seasons of data. We will have to wait another few seasons to check on that one. &lt;em&gt;*Vancouver plays on Astroturf while the other three play on Field Turf. &lt;/em&gt; _&lt;/strong&gt;DCU’s field at RFK is a little wider at 72 yards, and actually a little shorter at 110 yards. _&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just recently discovered that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://golazo.mlssoccer.com/&quot;&gt;Golazo web application&lt;/a&gt;-—with up-to-the-minute statistical game information courtesy of MLSsoccer.com—-provides details for teams in the final third. Sadly enough they don’t keep the data available for long so I took advantage of a late evening to tally up the following numbers over the nine MLS matches this weekend.

There really isn’t much in the way of true context at this point. Some of this is information is still about style rather than performance, but comparing the results and then applying some added data will be interesting. I wonder what, if anything, can be determined by this type of data. I’d love to hear inputs from all you smart people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/mls-attacking-third/#54&quot; title=&quot;2013-08-03 13:04:28&quot;&gt;Chris Gluck&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Harrison, Saw this for the first time today in prep for the podcast - good stuff - for better context - take total passes throughout game, then take these pass totals, and then shots taken, shots on goal and goals scored… to see if a linear relationship exists - one thing I would add is that passing as a penetration into the attacking third might miss dribble penetrations… not sure if that is available. Oddly enough, not sure why but the difference between passing attempts in attacking third and successful passes in the attacking third was only 1 off the overall total GSO’s I logged for Portland ‘and’ the GSO’s I logged for San Jose… In other words my GSO’s for Portland in that game were 53 and unsuccessful passes that game was 54… as for San Jose I tracked 37 GSO’s and the difference was 35. I’m not offering that there is a relationship yet but it is intriguing :) one additional thing - i don’t know if this data separates out assists or shots taken different from a pass - in the OPTA chalkboard an assist is counted as a successful pass but a shot taken isn’t… All the best, Chris&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week we talk US National Team and look back on their group play, specifically the game against Costa Rica. We also take a look at some things that we’re glad for, and for other things…well, not so much. We also talk Jozy Altidore and American soccer players’ market values. And to conclude, we review our predictions from Real Salt Lake and FC Dallas match from last week and preview LA Galaxy at home against Vancouver. I hope you enjoy!

      <title>Making Note of Interesting MLS Moves: Brandon McDonald</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/brandon-mcdonald-dcu-rsl/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/brandon-mcdonald-dcu-rsl/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re going to see a lot of people forever reference a term for finding something undervalued relative to what it provides. Such moves in sports are often spun off as “moneyball” type moves. I love the idea of finding undervalued assets, things that can have their production used in a manner which it benefits someone who actually needs it. The problem is most of the time when people refer to something as “moneyball” it’s mostly just butchering the term or passing off a sale for the sake of either saving face or trying to sound semi-intelligent about an acquisition. It just seems to be an overused term in sports today and it has started to defeat the principle of the idea. And then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/sports/56607137-77/mcdonald-lake-salt-defender.html.csp&quot;&gt;there is this.&lt;/a&gt;.. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The basic premise of ‘Money Ball’ is that you try to acquire undervalued assets,” general manager Garth Lagerwey said. “We’ve had a long track record of picking up pieces that other people don’t want anymore and cultivating their talents, and that’s a credit to our coaching staff and the guys in our locker room who believe in our system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garth Lagerway, the current General Manager of Real Salt Lake, is explaining why he just worked out a deal with the worst team in the league for a player they just benched. The narrative delivered by the Salt Lake press is rather uninteresting and all together doesn’t matter. What is interesting, at least to me, is the outlook for an RSL team that has sought to add depth to their weakness. While being a club that has been pretty much on par with teams like the Portland Timbers and Seattle Sounders in terms of allowing shots, they’ve been outstanding preventing those opportunities from turning into goals. You could of course point to Nick Rimando, but also Josh Saunders who worked a shut out of his own against FC Dallas this past weekend. However, no amounts of Saunders and Rimando are going to help the Lakers keep up with that rate. The only way they can be assured of limiting future goals is by limiting future attempts. Enter Brandon McDonald, formerly of the last place DC United, who was owed approximately 275K at the start of this season. He’s hardly a “money ball” type buy. But a couple points have been mentioned. Lagerway surrendered &lt;del&gt;basically nothing&lt;/del&gt; very little (third-round pick (2014) and a conditional choice (2015), neither of which should have much, if any impact to the United and their chances at fielding a competitive team next season) in order to acquire someone who was instrumental in enabling his club to make a late second half run into the playoffs last season. I’m sure our own DCU season ticket holder, Drew, and others can speak more to how well he’s performed this season. The standards set by Squwaka have him ranked as the #71 overall defender (among &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; defenders) with a performance score an even 150, though sorted purely by defensive score he ranks 57th overall with a score of 93. Turning to the other side of the analytical coin; Whoscored ranks him as the #2 best performer with a rating of 7.02 and leading the team in defensive actions and more specifically block shots. Okay, so comparing him to his peers, he’s probably not “worthy” of being a bench guy on the last place team. But is he worth the 100+ thousand dollars that RSL will owe him this season on the rest of his contract. The answer is surprising. According to a couple of anonymous sources and general digging, it appears that Real Salt Lake may have a solid collection of allocation money saved for a rainy day and possibly used to pay down McDonald’s salary. Now, we don’t know much about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sounderatheart.com/2012/12/23/3797066/allocation-money&quot;&gt;allocation money&lt;/a&gt;, and the amounts that teams have are a well-guarded secret. But I was told that they planned on using a small amount on McDonald and now suddenly his salary isn’t so influential on the salary cap. This is an interesting move and one that could go either way, good or bad. I’m not sure I would call this a “moneyball” move. But it’s certainly interesting and it’s something that I think you’ll see more of as teams fall away from the pack. It’s expensive to find players outside of the league, and many teams are in a state of transition (Seattle, for one) and do not necessarily have all the finances usually afforded them. Buying low or taking advantage of players that teams are ready to sell on—-but can still be useful to &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; team—-is always a smart business practice. I guess that kind of would qualify as a “undervalued asset”. Right there, I made my own skin crawl.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, we talked about PDO…a lot. We likely will continue to talk about PDO and monitor it through the season. After games played this past weekend here are the up-to-date rankings. I know that Matthias usually just updates his page on Monday, but I’m actually going to make these a post so that when I want to do a week-by-week investigation later on this off-season, it saves me time.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hope you all have enjoyed the build up to this week’s podcast concerning PDO. In today’s episode we review the Gold Cup situation with the Mens National Team, talk a bit about PDO, and then preview Real Salt Lake and Dallas FC (so that you can see how grossly wrong we were). Enjoy!

If you’re trying to figure out what to look at, there are a couple of things that may, possibly, &lt;em&gt;jump&lt;/em&gt; out at you. The first being the New England Revolution sandwiched between the two best teams in MLS, Portland and Montreal. Admittedly, the club has been on a sort of hot streak but it a large percentage of their PDO comes from the lack of goals they’ve conceded. Opposing clubs have the worst conversion rate of Goals/Shots against New England. Similarly, you see Sporting Kansas City sitting 15th in PDO and can’t help but be a little bit scared of what could come in the second half should there be positive regression. Considering all the head scratching that the media and supporters have concerning Seattle’s early exploits, Sporting has gone largely unnoticed with an underwhelming start. Yet, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://11tegen11.net/2012/12/01/introducing-the-relative-shots-rate/&quot;&gt;TSR&lt;/a&gt; (explanation linked—we’ll get into this more down the road) is very much there and so are the points. An interesting out come for a club that (deservedly) had the hype machine cranked to full. Oh, and DC United is definitely still a combination bad and unlucky. Sorry, Drew.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Possession Confusion Update</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/possession-confusion-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/possession-confusion-update/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/possession-confusion/&quot;&gt;I wrote back in May&lt;/a&gt; about the paradoxical nature of OPTA’s possession statistic in MLS—-how more possession corresponds to better shot ratios, better shot ratios correspond to better goal differentials, but somehow more possession does not correspond to better goal differentials when we control for certain variables. In fact, I found that once I controlled for the teams playing in a given game, possession had a negative correlation with goal differential and winning. The new data agrees with the old. Correlations suggest that team possession still correlates positively with scoring attempts (p-value = 0.01), scoring attempts still correlate positively to goal differential (p-value = 0.02), and now with more data, possession is also positively correlated to goal differential (p-value = 0.01). That all seems to line up with logic, but the paradox from before still exists. When I look game-by-game and control for the home and away teams, in-game possession has a positive correlation to shot ratio, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;but a negative correlation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to goal differential. In other words, the team that has more possession in a given game tends to also earn more shot attempts, but still loses more frequently than we would expect. As mentioned in the first article back in May, this seems paradoxical. I had some theories in that article, but reader David Stringer &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/possession-confusion/#comments&quot;&gt;got me to think about&lt;/a&gt; another logical explanation. Teams that develop leads tend to sit back more defensively, and often are satisfied allowing the opponent to possess all it wants in less dangerous parts of the pitch. A team that has a lead in the second half probably  got that lead because it was generating more opportunities (read: attempts). It makes sense that the team that eventually went on to win also produced better shot ratios early on before getting the lead. After getting the lead, the team in front was willing to give up extreme possession relative to a more neutral shot rate. Thus it ends the game with poor possession, but a still favorable shot rate. Just a theory, and I’d love to hear about other ideas! The stats are definitely not lying. These correlations are very real, but the causes for the possession paradox are still elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/possession-confusion-update/#142&quot; title=&quot;2013-11-13 00:18:53&quot;&gt;Harrison Crow&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Optas possessions statistics is based upon touches, if I’m not mistaken. But studies have been conducted by both and from my under standing neither specifically correlate to goals scored. However, chained passes—such as passes that are made in consecutive order Henry to Johnny Steele to Cahill back to Henry—if I understand it right has a higher correlative relationship to goals scored. I think there is a lot of chaos involved in possession that it may not ever be something that can be used in the sense that it’s representative of how a team specificly played. That said, I would love to do a Game state possession metric. It would be much more involved than what we (ASA) have the ability to conduct at this point. But maybe next season if we reach some of our goals we may be able go at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/possession-confusion-update/#144&quot; title=&quot;2013-11-13 00:47:05&quot;&gt;Matthias Kullowatz&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; I also think it would be really interesting to look at possession (both time and touches/passes) by game state. In fact, that very well may explain the whole paradox that we’re seeing. If teams simply choose not to possess in advantageous game states, then the correlation makes a lot of sense. In terms of fantasy football, I love it when my quarterback’s team goes down early. Rack those yards up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/possession-confusion-update/#141&quot; title=&quot;2013-11-13 00:01:05&quot;&gt;Ken Krauss&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; I think the “possession paradox” is probably due to teams bunkering in after they get the lead. They have scored, and now they don’t need to possess the ball, they need to defend. Possession demands having players in advanced positions down the field, because teams aren’t going to want to hold the ball long in front of their own goal, especially not with the lead. Having players in advanced positions means more running for their players because they’re going to have to fall back to defense when their teams turns it over in order to protect the lead. Some teams don’t play this way but most do. Teams with the lead are generally going to pick and choose when they go forward, and then they’ll only go forward fairly cautiously keeping an extra man or two back on defense. This paradox reminds me of something I noticed when I joined some friends’ fantasy football league for the first time a few years ago — a lot of time the losing quarterback in a game has better stats and puts up as many or more fantasy points as the winning quarterback. Why? Winning teams start handing the ball off to the running back to slow the game down and run out the clock while losing teams start airing it out to catch up. Lots of passes obviously will help a quarterback’s stats but that doesn’t mean they’re winning the game. Also, it can show a team that can move the ball but not put it in the end zone. In soccer, I think it’s much the same. Not only is the winning team trying to kill the clock so they’re content with lots of turnovers as they kick it long up the field or out of bounds as long as minutes are taken off the clock but the “possession paradox” can also show a team that is frustrated in the offensive third as well. If the other team is not able to score, it’s easier to let that team keep the ball. If the other team is scoring, you don’t want to let them keep it! I’m not sure I agree with Opta’s counting of touches instead of time in their possession stats, however. I think time of possession is more in line with how the game is played. A good team will control the game by slowing the game down at times and speeding it up at others. It would be interesting to see if the “possession paradox” exists for time of possession as well. Ideally, I would like to know both time of possession and the number of touches taken by a team. Not just passes, but dribbles as well. It would also be interesting to break the rates of possession down by score as well — whether the teams are tied, one team up by a goal, two goals, etc. Then it would be easier to see how much a team’s rate of possession depends on the score and if teams were sacrificing possession in order to defend more effectively with the lead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A little information on: PDO</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/pdo-mls-soccer/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the holiday behind us we can once again start to return to the business at hand. The half-way mark is upon us and MLS has given us an exciting and very tight race across both the Western and Eastern conferences. With that comes another week of podcasts. #AnalysisEvolved. This week we plan on talking a bit about a statistic by the name PDO. Unlike how you might imagine most statistic names coming about, or things with three random letters, this is not an acronym. It’s pronounced how it’s sounds. Originally a hockey metric, PDO is simply the sum of save percentage and scoring percentage, then multiplied times 1000. The rest of the history as it applies to soccer isn’t necessarily important. A great introduction to the idea and how it applies to the sport is given by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mc79hockey.com/?p=2996&quot;&gt;Tyler Dellow of mc79hockey.com&lt;/a&gt;, and there is another introduction on the site &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pensionplanpuppets.com/2010/6/1/1495214/advanced-team-stats-what-the-heck&quot;&gt;Pension Plan Puppet&lt;/a&gt; by one “Skinny Fish.” Both sites give examples of how PDO can potentially isolate a team’s performance over the course of a season and compare those to past performances, various incarnations of the team, and of course, other teams. &lt;del&gt;I can’t directly attribute who was the first to apply the team analysis to the sport of soccer&lt;/del&gt;(Grayson confirmed he was the first…). But the oldest article I can find referencing its usage within the sport comes from the ever-smart and sophisticated &lt;del&gt;Canuck&lt;/del&gt;, James Grayson. His series of introductions to the metric is linked below. &lt;a href=&quot;http://jameswgrayson.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/a-primer-pdo/&quot;&gt;A Premier: PDO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jameswgrayson.wordpress.com/2011/04/05/pdo-part-i/&quot;&gt;PDO – part I&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jameswgrayson.wordpress.com/2011/04/15/pdo-part-ii/&quot;&gt;PDO – part II&lt;/a&gt; Along with an explanation of the stat and some information about how it regresses to the mean—-because it’s fantastic at doing that—-there is also a bit of information about how it can be used to compare different clubs to one another. Basically, it comes down to being one of the best methods to determine the barometer of a team. While we can look at point totals and standings in the table, PDO can reasonably tell us if a team is over performing or under performing. I’m not in any way an expert on this stat. There are of course some occasions were you may run into issues with trying to apply it to a specific scenario, and I could point anyone in search of more answers on the subject in better directions than toward myself. I could easily name about a dozen or so people that are much more versed in this metric than I am. However, since we were going to take about it on our podcast this weekend, I wanted to give the reader/listener an opportunity to find some quick and easy references to the material before hearing us talk about it this weekend. I’ll have an updated PDO standings for you all tomorrow which will lead into our discussions on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing Shot Locations</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/introducing-shot-locations/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/introducing-shot-locations/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the site and on &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/american-soccer-analysis-podcast/id660030731&quot;&gt;the podcast&lt;/a&gt; we have discussed shot rates an awful lot. A team’s shot rate is simply how many shots it has taken divided by how many shots it has conceded to its opponents. Whenever I make a Game-of the-Week prediction on the podcast, you’ll hear me use two primary pieces of information: which team is at home and which team has recorded the better shot rate. In general, shot rates help to explain not only the relative number of scoring opportunities a team has given itself, but also the relative number of scoring opportunities it is likely to get in the future. It’s &lt;em&gt;predictive&lt;/em&gt;. There are, however, some conspicuous outliers in the league—teams that just don’t seem to follow the rules. Harrison wrote earlier this week about Montreal’s shot data. While Montreal gives up far more shots that it earns for itself, Harrison &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/06/18/montreal-impact-shot-locations/&quot;&gt;pointed out that&lt;/a&gt; Marco Di Vaio and company also place the ball quite well, finding the lower corners a high percentage of the time. Perhaps Montreal’s own finishing rate is for real. But I won’t be convinced about the low rate at which teams have finished against Montreal before first delving into some new numbers. We have our own shot location data here at American Soccer Analysis, now, and I’m going to use it. &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/scoring-areas-of-field.png&quot; alt=&quot;Scoring Zones&quot;&gt;I have broken the field down into six primary scoring zones (seen to the right) in the hopes of accounting for the difficulty of both angle and distance.  It is possible that some teams earn a higher quality of opportunities rather than a higher quantity—or vice versa. In addition to recording where each team gets its own shots, I have also gathered the locations of the shots that each team has given up defensively from each zone. Here are some interesting tidbits about Montreal’s defense. Despite being ahead much of the time—which would seemingly encourage low-quality attempts—Montreal still gives up a league-average proportion of shots from high-scoring zones one and two. In fact, if Montreal’s opponents had finished their attempts from zones one and two at the league average clip, Montreal would have given &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;up six additional goals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; this season. However, including all six zones, Montreal would have given up just two additional goals due to some unlucky results from distance. Because Montreal has played a wide range of opponents, it would make sense that its goal scoring rates &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;against&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; would stabilize to something close to league norms. It turns out, for the most part, that those rates have stabilized. The zones help to control for difficulty of shots, and Montreal’s defense isn’t getting particularly lucky based on the shots it is allowing. The major controversy still lies in the Impact’s offense, and whether or not it can sustain a league-leading finishing rate. According to its shot locations, the Impact “should have” scored eight fewer goals this season. On the flip side we have Sporting Kansas City. Unlike Montreal, the Wiz have dominated &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/&quot;&gt;the league&lt;/a&gt; all season in shot rates, and yet find themselves third in the East in points per match. Could quality of shots be playing a role? Possibly. Sporting KC gets more shots from zones two and four than the league average team, and those tend to be decent scoring zones. SKC has outscored its opponents by five goals on the season, but with average finishing rates from each zone, one would expect a goal differential closer to +7 or +8. SKC has underachieved by only about two goals according to the shot locations data. How much of that difference is skill versus luck is still well beyond this blogger, but maybe someday… &lt;em&gt;*Own goals are taken out of the shot locations data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We like raw numbers around these parts. The lowest common denominator the better. But we &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; numbers in general, it’s as if we are… kind of involved. There isn’t much in the way of discrimination. You can take Numbers, and they can tell a story. Numbers can be just as biased as any news reporter or general fan too. They can also help give us insight to a specific question that we may have. A popular question around these parts is simply: why is Montreal so good? A club racing towards an opportunity for Supporting Shield. They sit 4th in the table with 26 points, two points behind the leading FC Dallas and have atleast two games in hand against all clubs above them in the standings. Obviously, they are in very good shape with a chance to run away this season with hardware. So how are they doing it? Well, the one specific point of contention for us is their shooting. Currently the Impact are 5th in the league in shots on target per match and even further down the pipe at 14th with total shots attempted per match. So the question then becomes, how have they scored 1.69 goals a game, good for &lt;strong&gt;best &lt;/strong&gt;in all of MLS? They’re shooting the lights out. Well, sort of. The ball is ending up in the back of the net at unusually high rates. Matthias and I have pretty much just summed this up to being  an irregularity, an outlier, and one that will eventually see the Impact coming back down to earth. And yet, they haven’t. Montreal have the highest goal scoring rate in the league, yet have the same goal differential as the New England Revolution that sit 11th in the Supporter Shield table. 6 of their 8 wins have been by won by a single goal margin. Which tell us they’ve been strong in holding their leads. It’s obviously something that could and likely will involve a much further investigation as time permits. But I did formulate some interesting enough thoughts while digging through Whoscored.com and Squawka data. &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/goal-locations.png&quot; alt=&quot;Goal Locations&quot;&gt; A good 80% of the goals are in high percentage conversation locations on the frame. Predominately low and presumably away from the keeper. You can see that trend continues with their overall shot selection. &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/shot-locations.png&quot; alt=&quot;shot locations&quot;&gt; The majority of their shots are all, again, in great places with one third of the total shots in the lower half of the frame. I’m not at this point sold that the Impact are going to come back down to earth with their conversion ratio. It’s not so much that they are taking shots, but the type of shots they are taking.&lt;strong&gt; Marco Di Vaio&lt;/strong&gt; is 36 and with that comes experience and intelligence. He understands what he’s doing. I believe that his effort to place high percentage shots is not only a skill; it’s purposeful, and it’s a game plan. I’m not sure if they can continue to win in their +1 goal states, but their defence&lt;em&gt; has been very good thus far. It’s possible, considering their current form, that they have a legit shot at the Supporter Shield at year’s end. Then again, we just may have to dig deeper into this.** _&lt;/em&gt;Editor’s note: Harrison is turning Redcoat on us.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;**Editor’s note: We will._&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My apologies for the timeliness of the podcast being deployed. At the latest, I usually try to get it up by noon on Sunday. Of course, that didn’t happen and you were subjected to my useless apologies that are as common as San Jose yellow cards. Anyway…  I spent the last week out among the gentle Dallas folk spending time with family. It was the last week that my wife’s doctor permitted travel out of our local area (ya’ know, she’s preggers). Since I was out of pocket, Drew and Matthias picked up the responsibility for the podcast and did a great job. They talked US Mens National Team, finally finished up our review of the Eastern Conference standings, added some US Open Cup talk, and closed out the show previewing the Portland Timbers and LA Galaxy match later on this week. Have a listen: [audio &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/asa-episode-9.mp3&quot;&gt;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/asa-episode-9.mp3&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Squawka Enters MLS Statistic Scene</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So last week, ironically at about this exact time, I wrote about WhoScored entering the realm of American soccer and how awesome and exciting it was that they were going to start providing and publishing statistics for MLS—-allowing us to skip the process of having to count up all the individual games, not to mention the time-consuming tables that Matty puts together. Now we have much of that information at our convenient disposal. Well we are getting even more spoiled as now Squawka joins the fray of MLS statistics. If you haven’t been to Squawka yet, you need to visit their site. It’s not just a great collection of information, it’s visually stimulating and helps put things into a context, helping to convey a message better than some writers, especially me, can convey. This isn’t just an awesome thing because it makes mine as well as my associates’ lives easier. It’s awesome because it’s adding to what WhoScored does, not competing with them. This isn’t FanGraphs vs. Baseball-Reference where you have similar but altogether different ways of arriving at thoughts and ideas that really confuse the hell out of you—-like when you are trying to come up with whether or not &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3830&amp;amp;position=P&quot;&gt;Ricky&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/n/nolasri01.shtml&quot;&gt;Nolasco&lt;/a&gt; had a good season. Sure there are some subtle differences between the two sites, and even how they end up rating a player. But this isn’t about exact sciences at this point. It’s more about making data prevalent. A big shout out goes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hififidelity&quot;&gt;Nic English&lt;/a&gt; and his crew for getting this out there. Job well done.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prediction versus Explanation</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/prediction-versus-explanation/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/prediction-versus-explanation/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a subtle, yet very important, distinction between explanation and prediction in most sports, and Major League Soccer is no different. I don’t intend to make this long or particularly math heavy, so hang on. Here’s a simple example of what I’m talking about when I refer to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In its first six games of the season, the Portland Timbers recorded 89 attempts and allowed just 57 to their opponents. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;During that same time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Portland scored ten goals while allowing eight. I might &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;explain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that the Timbers’ +2 goal differential was due—at least in part—to earning more offensive opportunities than their opponents. Here’s another example, but this time in regards to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;prediction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In their first six games, the New England Revolution scored two goals while allowing six to its opponents. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;During its next six games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, New England scored eight goals while allowing just three to its opponents. Using just New England as an example, it would seem as though goal scoring in the past (-4) poorly &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;predicted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; goal scoring in the future (+5).  Of course, we have nineteen teams, not two, so I sorted through all nineteen teams looking for patterns. Here is what I found. A team’s goal differential during its first six games &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;explained&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; its total points over that same time period extremely well (R2 was 77%). This is not surprising. Teams that tend to score more goals than their opponents also tend to win more games. Nothing shocking there. However, a team’s goal differential in the first six games of the season provided no help in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;predicting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; its total points over the next six games. Here’s the plot on that one: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/gd-vs-future-points-6-weeks-2013.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;GD vs. Future Points - 6 weeks 2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is virtually no relationship between how well a team scored before, and then how many points it earned later. In other words, goal differentials are not predictive over six games. But if you’re convinced the lack of predictive ability is completely due to a small sample size of twelve total games, check this out. A team’s attempts differential in its first six games shows a statistically significant correlation to both its future goal differential and points earned: &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ad-vs-gd-and-ad-vs-pts.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AD vs. GD and AD vs. Pts&quot;&gt;   Because it’s sports, prediction is never going to be precise, and these aren’t perfect correlations at all. But I find it particularly impressive that over just twelve total games, the attempts data from a team’s first six games shows statistically significant predictive ability of the team’s results in the next six games. If you’ve listened to our Game-of-the-Week section during our podcasts, you hear us talking a lot about shot ratios. This post hopefully clarified why we do that. Past shot ratios are better than past results at predicting future results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While digging through Wikipedia and various articles yesterday, I noticed the following. In 2010, after the expansion draft, DC United traded midfielder &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helbert_Frederico_Carreiro_da_Silva&quot;&gt;Fred Carreiro&lt;/a&gt;, allocation money and the #8 pick in the 2010 super draft to Philadelphia in return for goalkeeper, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Perkins&quot;&gt;Troy Perkins&lt;/a&gt;. That #8 draft pick was used to draft &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_McInerney&quot;&gt;Jack McInerney&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe you’ve heard of him. Keep that in mind when people mention the need for DC to find a goal scorer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DC United Score Alain Rochart On The Cheap</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/dc-united-alain-rochart/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, the Vancouver Whitecaps traded defender &lt;strong&gt;Alain Rochart&lt;/strong&gt;, their starting left back, to DC United for &lt;a href=&quot;http://metronews.ca/news/vancouver/697810/whitecaps-trade-alain-rochat-to-d-c-united/&quot;&gt;a second-round selection in the 2015 MLS SuperDraft as well as an conditional pick in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Vancouver gets a rough lottery ticket, a little bit of freed up cash and the United get a veteran defensive back.  It’s not specified if Vancouver will still be on the hook for Rochart’s salary, but considering the lack of return, for the basis of this work I’m going to assume that to be the case. The trade on the peripherals seems rather odd and strikes a few questions in my mind as to why this move was even made and what EXACTLY did each team acquire. Looking at the Swede, Alain Rochat, DC United obviously get a guy who is average positionally in the league. He’s not brilliant by any stretch of the imagination, but he’s not bad at what he does. He’s going to give you minutes; he’s given the Whitecaps back-to-back seasons of nearly 2,500 minutes. While being able to provide minutes is great, the larger issue is the quality of those minutes. How does he compare to the rest of the league?  According to the site Whoscored.com they have him listed as the 9th best starting left back in MLS and is the 8th highest paid. So over all the price tag pretty much suits what  he costs, though the &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; cost of an outside back is roughly $100k. &lt;/p&gt;

Interestingly enough, Rochart matches up pretty well with Portland Timbers left back Michael Harrington, who costs just a nudge more and is rated very similarly. Both possess the ball well and deliver smart short passes out of the back while neither are very strong at tackling. This comparison is interesting simply because the Timbers acquired Harrington from Sporting Kansas City this past off-season. While the details of the deal aren’t disclosed to the public, we know that it centered around allocation money and  a guess in the $75K range isn’t crazy. So we can say the going rate for which DC United paid for is roughly $75K in “&lt;em&gt;specialized&lt;/em&gt; “cap space. That’s on top of the money that is saved from moving the individual. DC United paid a draft pick, potentially two, depending on the circumstances—of which we have no idea. So let’s just work with the understanding that they are only giving up a second round pick in two years. This is a little tricky because of the fact that we don’t necessarily know what overall pick DC United will be giving up. While this matters only for the sake of history and being able to create context based upon past experiences, it only minimally limits our understanding of the value of this pick. In the 2013 Superdraft, a second-round pick’s average contract was worth roughly 35K, and that’s specifically for a young-ish sort of player that qualifies for the draft. While that potentially could be of some value, you can see players such as &lt;strong&gt;Chris Klute&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Chris Tierney&lt;/strong&gt; and&lt;strong&gt; Seth Sinovic&lt;/strong&gt; as great examples, as it could lend itself to assisting to provide some roster flexibility. It’s not nearly as lucrative as any type of allocation money.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Game Of The Week Review: Montreal Impact Visit Sporting Kansas City</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know I shouldn’t be surprised by the Impact stealing a match on the road, especially considering Sporting’s lack of strength at home as of their recent string of outcomes. Though, with all the statistical pointers, it’s quiet uncanny that they came up with even a point, let alone all three. &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/skc-imp.png&quot; alt=&quot;SKC-IMP&quot;&gt; It’s hard to look at the tackles, interceptions and clearances and not think that it’s a by product of the Impact largely being on their heels for the majority of the match. That in large part is due to the style which the Montreal Impact implements. The team as a whole has functioned with 48% possession through 12 matches and even less possession (44%) in away games. It’s not a bad thing, but it naturally produces more defensive events. Much of our discussion during the podcasts has dealt with shots and their predictive nature. Montreal has been at the forefront of the discussion, with amazing results despite being outshot on both total attempts at goal (12 to 15 per game) and actual shots on target (4.9 to 5.2) Montreal Impact is currently now sporting 26 points with a goal differential of +7. Not to mention they are boasting the highest conversion rate in the league of 15.3%. Better than the next highest (FC Dallas, 13.9%) by nearly a whole point and a half. Matthias, Drew and I have discussed whether or not Montreal can continue to maintain such a high finishing rate. It’s a legitimate question considering the construct of the situation but, as pointed out by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/analyseFooty/status/341571522672070657&quot;&gt;Ravi Ramineni&lt;/a&gt; in a discussion this morning on twitter, ‏the problem with making such assertions is that we’re looking purely at the shot totals rather than looking at the qualitative state of the shot. However, while it’s interesting enough to question whether or not the Impact are going to stick around and continue to score goals at their current rate, I’m going to leave that for another day. It’s even more interesting that Kansas City came up with twice the amount of attempts on goal and the only scored once. That one goal was on a foul that was made right on the line of the 18 yard box. Had the linesman not been on his game, that call could have easily been a free kick. The question that I really have is more of why was Sporting unable to build upon their chances. Looking at the amount of clearances that the Impact had  I kind of wondered if the fact was that they just couldn’t maintain the needed pressure upon Troy Perkins goal. &lt;/p&gt;

First at the 69th-71st minute, Again with the 76th and 78th minute and then in the final moments game a solid run of 90 to 94, ending with Kei Kamra’s shot that just drifted wide. Ultimately, I’m more inclined to believe that Sporting did just as much to not earn a result as the Impact did to really earn one. But while most people would be willing to chalk this game up to luck, I just think it’s the largest example of what the Impact do well, and that’s disrupting opposing teams while allowing the Impact to sit in their own defensive third. I’m still not inclined, as I’m sure Matty isn’t either, to give the Impact the full rights of being a team that is “for real”. But they certainly continue to prove their case week in and week out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Finding Numbers: WhoScored And Their Expanding American Statistics</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/finding-numbers-whoscored-and-their-expanding-american-statistics/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve stated that one of the goals for this site is the production of numbers, but also generally using them as book markers to bits of information. I haven’t been too good about this second part but I’m going to try to get better. One thing that was pointed out to me this last week (h/t &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sternbc&quot;&gt;Brian Stern&lt;/a&gt;) was that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whoscored.com/Regions/233/Tournaments/85/USA-Major-League-Soccer&quot;&gt;WhoScored &lt;/a&gt;has at long last increased the information that they provide on MLS. We’ve had a link to WhoScored for sometime but generally speaking they haven’t been very good about keeping the information updated, keeping it accurate or producing anything worth visiting it on a consistent basis. But the fact that they have some basic visuals and do have good content for most of the rest of the world makes it a worthy site. There was also the hope that they would finally find the time to spend on the American-based league. Well, now they have and it’s pretty awesome. For instance; if I wanted to know who averages the most passes for the San Jose Earthquakes, I could go in real quickly and see that &lt;strong&gt;Sam Cronin&lt;/strong&gt; averages 45.2 passes per game, almost a whole 8 above the trailer &lt;strong&gt;Ramiro Corrales&lt;/strong&gt; (37.9), and that Cronin has completed 475 of 633 passes. The only thing at this point in time that could be better is for it to give a spray chart of where he likes to pass and to whom. I could see that, according to the stats, Philadelphia has yet to score purely on a counter attack and seems to favor carrying the ball down the right side of the pitch, as they use that side 37% of the time. Alternatively we can see that DC United has taken 65% of its shots from the middle of the pitch. But mostly what it does is it allows us to do is put things in context. Is it unusual that Houston attempts short passes 80% of the time, or is that normal? Well I can see that DC United and the Columbus Crew make short passes at 78%, but short passes make up 82% of the Montreal Impact’s pass attempts. There isn’t a wrong or right amount of short passes, but it does help us understand the specific influence of the style and attack. You may or may not have already seen WhoScored and you may or may not have seen that they updated their American side site. That’s cool. This is for those that didn’t hear. We’re trying to make it easier for people to conduct their own analysis and do so in the most educated way possible. As a side note it looks like they further plan to expand the information they provide on the US Leagues as they have NASL section dated later on this year, probably anticipated for the second half of their season. That could further help us when attempting to gather information on some of the US Open Cup teams and some of the lesser known players who don’t have an opportunity to have their name shine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GAME OF THE WEEK: Los Angeles VS. Seattle</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the weekend was filled with barbecues, families, and time away from the pseudo grind of the world, we decided to skip out on our weekly podcast. But we all love our “Game of the Week” contest so much that we decided to still preview tonight’s game of the week between Seattle and LA. This is what we do for you, America. This is our service.  &lt;strong&gt;DREW:&lt;/strong&gt; The LA Galaxy are playing a soccer game? ESPN, you know what to do… broadcast it at a time when everyone East of Utah will be asleep! After last week’s Galaxy v Red Bulls snoozefest took 89 minutes for anything to happen, ESPN has decided to go double or nothing and show the slumping Galaxy against a Seattle team on a roll. It has largely been because &lt;strong&gt;Lamar Neagle&lt;/strong&gt; (no, seriously) has either found out how to use those &lt;a href=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5284/5370026525_6eea3e1138_b.jpg&quot;&gt;neon jerseys&lt;/a&gt; to blind defenders, or finally decided he’s an MLS quality striker. After Seattle started the season unable to score goals, the Sounders are now getting them in bunches. Or as I like to put it: they’re regressing to the mean with a vengeance! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the Galaxy, their dependence on &lt;strong&gt;Juninho&lt;/strong&gt; was exposed last week after a hard tackle from his namesake forced him to leave the game early. Los Angeles never got back into sync with him off the field, and New York dominated the rest of the game. As of this writing, his status is still up in the air, but If the Galaxy are going to keep &lt;strong&gt;Ozzie Alonso&lt;/strong&gt; in check they’ll need &lt;strong&gt;Juninho&lt;/strong&gt; to keep him occupied. Should Garcia (or anyone else) get the start in Juninho’s place, then Alonso will get more forward than he otherwise would, freeing up Neagle, Martins, and family to attack the net. Couple that with the fact that &lt;strong&gt;Carlo Cudicini&lt;/strong&gt; has looked as good in goal this season as &lt;strong&gt;Jimmy Nielsen&lt;/strong&gt; looks in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SportingKC/status/337244634994601984&quot;&gt;jorts&lt;/a&gt;, and the Galaxy could be in for a hurtin’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, the Galaxy have been very solid at home this season, and the Fishing Village to the North have found their scoring touch at home, but still struggle to get goals on the road. My prediction: if Juninho plays, the Galaxy will pull this out 2-1. If not, it will be a 1-1 draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MATTHIAS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sounders have come on strong recently, recording 13 points in their last five matches. I checked for a recent dip in Seattle’s strength of schedule, but there was no such dip to be found. Seattle has played three of those last five matches on the road, including a win on the road in Kansas City and a win at home over Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sounders’ win at Colorado shouldn’t be overlooked either. I will be coming out with a strength of schedule index soon, but my beta version* suggests that the Rapids have played the toughest schedule to this point (along with New England). That’s not to mention that, as the away team, Seattle was giving up an estimated third-of-a-goal in an uphill battle. Impressive stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after saying all those wonderful things about Seattle, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;my three points this week go to the Galaxy in a one-goal victory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Though the Sounders find themselves second in the tables in goal differential, they are second to the Galaxy. Though the Sounders have an impressive 1.21 Shots-on-goal Ratio, the Galaxy have outdone them again at 1.37. Though the Sounders’ strength of schedule has been difficult recently, over the course of the season it’s the Galaxy that have faced seemingly tougher opponents. The final nail in the coffin is that the game will be played in Los Angeles, and that third-of-a-goal advantage will lie with the Galaxy. LA drew more than 20,000 fans to its last home match on May 5th, and you can bet they’ll show up for the red hot Sounders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Strength of schedule is currently based on opponents’ goal differentials and shots-on-goal ratios.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HARRISON:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write a lot about the Sounders over the course of the week so let me make this simple. They were taking shots; at first they weren’t going in and then, recently, they started all going in. Somewhere in between these two truths lies the median of this organization. They aren’t as good or as lucky as what they’ve been in cumulatively over the past 2 1/2 weeks. But they certainly weren’t as bad as what they were to start the season. It’s a bit difficult to gauge the true talent level of this squad because of how frequent these parts are moving about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, for the Sounders, &lt;strong&gt;Ozzie Alonso &lt;/strong&gt;is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.thenewstribune.com/soccer/2013/05/21/sounders-roster-remains-fluid-due-to-call-in-injuries/&quot;&gt;suffering from a groin strain&lt;/a&gt; that will probably prevent him from making an appearance and &lt;strong&gt;Steve Zakuani&lt;/strong&gt; is still not able to go this weekend. Which will force the Sounders to work with an inopportune 18 and even a less-conducive starting XI. This isn’t something new to them this year, but I imagine that it’s still going to be tough for them to deal with due to how Los Angeles works the ball through the middle of the field with &lt;strong&gt;Marcelo Sarvas.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Galaxy are also dealing with injuries to their central midfield—-specifically with Juninho who, as Drew mentioned above, was taken out ironically enough by a rough tackle from New York’s opposing Juninho. Los Angeles uses an assortment of means to move the ball up the pitch. They average more shots than their opponents, more possessions and longer ones by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tempofreesoccer.blogspot.com/2013/03/2013-mls-tempo-free-table.html&quot;&gt;standard of TFS.&lt;/a&gt; Despite that, they’ve managed an impressive 17 points in 11 games and are still considered one of the more unlucky teams in all the league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to their attack the athletic &lt;strong&gt;Robbie Rogers&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;Landon Donovan—-&lt;/strong&gt;who has something to prove to Jurgen Klinsmann—-and all of a sudden you have a club that is very dangerous and probably one of the better ones in the league. Add that to the likelihood of the Sounders shot-to-goal ratio coming back to earth and the absence of Ozzie Alonso, and you end up with a very likely Galaxy win at home. I don’t think it’s going to be anywhere a long the lines of the Sounders defeat from the playoffs, but a 2-1 victory wouldn’t surprise me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-—-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Standings (as best as I can remember them):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew 0 - 3 ; Prediction: LA (if Juninho plays)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthias 2 - 3 ; Prediction: LA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison 1 - 4 ; Prediction: LA&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Game of the Week: (A Rather Late) #LAGvsNYRB Review</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked quite a bit about game states on the blog over the last few weeks, both linking certain articles as well as talking about it on the podcast. The ability to take specific events and associate context with them to provide a better understanding of the match results is helpful. However, there are times when I think Game States need to be refined based upon the situation. Take for instance our “game of the week” selection, New York Red Bulls at home against the potent Los Angeles Galaxy. There is a lot I could say about leaving &lt;strong&gt;Mike Magee&lt;/strong&gt; behind in LA and losing &lt;strong&gt;Juninho&lt;/strong&gt; just 10 minutes into the match. Attempting to use the typical goal game state doesn’t really work simply because of the lone goal was scored at the 91 minute mark. If we were looking at this in a season long context and we wanted to see how good a team was in the “even goal state,” or maybe how long they played in an even goal state, 90+ minutes of data this match would go towards that game state and presumably help speak to each team’s ability. The problem is that on an individual game basis sometimes there is a need for another way to really apply context to this game. Naturally, with the injury to&lt;strong&gt; Juninho &lt;/strong&gt;the first thought is to apply game states to substitutions rather than goals. The problem with that—-omitting &lt;strong&gt;Juninho’s&lt;/strong&gt; substitution—-is that substitutions take place in bunches in the second at the end of the game. It’s becomes difficult to separate where exactly there was a specific difference maker. So I kind of abandoned the thought of single game states in this scenario and instead looked more for another pattern. &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/lagalaxy1.jpg?w=890&quot; alt=&quot;LAGalaxy&quot;&gt; Above is a bit from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2013-05-19-NY-v-LA/chalkboard&quot;&gt;MLS site chalkboard&lt;/a&gt;. Events on the timeline have been taken from each team, and each has a corresponding event associated with it on the map of the pitch. I specifically used offensive-associated filters to help give me an idea of the effectiveness of each team and how often it was involved. The specific filters used were: Through balls, Crosses (both successful and unsuccessful), Key Passes, Shots on target, shots off target and lastly, blocked shots. These are all decisively aggressive methods that appreciate a teams ability to drive towards the opposing goal. I’m not exactly sure what to make of all it, there are almost distinctive time blocks that belong to each team as they would hold the ball and look for their own attempts on goal. You can see that each team had a couple of chances in the last 10 minutes and it came down to a bit of luck in the circumstances of the lone goal. The timeline itself looks almost like heart beat rhythm between each team and their respective attempts towards the opposing goal. This is kind of the pattern I was looking to find, but I don’t exactly know what to do with it. In summation of the actual game, you could make some &lt;strong&gt;Carlos Cudicini&lt;/strong&gt; references—-see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MLS_Analyst/status/336227431822266369&quot;&gt;Matthew Doyle for snark&lt;/a&gt;-—and put a nice little bow on it. Yes, I do agree that LA’s Italian keeper should have come out of his goal to clear the attempt, but I happen to also think that this single game came down to a rather random occurrence. A simple mistake from a goal keeper who has been in residence at some prestigious clubs. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/&quot;&gt;league average team finishes a shot roughly once every 10 attempts&lt;/a&gt;. The New York Red Bulls scored on what was their 10th attempt at goal. While LA was stuck at 9. I know it’s not popular but I believe that sometimes it’s not necessarily about strategy or anything deep tactically. Instead, maybe it’s about fighting for 90 minutes, putting up as many (good) shots as possible and hoping one of them goes in. That sounds a bit Charles Reepish… I know, but sometimes it’s true. Sometimes the ball just finds its way into the back of the net. Humans make mistakes and even the best goal keepers do, too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Possession Confusion</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/possession-confusion/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/possession-confusion/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Consider every conversation ever had about soccer tactics. I would bet 99.9% of them touched on one specific subject: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;possession&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Whether it’s the men’s league team you play for, or the club team you cheer for, isn’t more possession always a good thing? I can’t answer that question confidently, but I will explore it. The first obstacle to analyzing and discussing possession in MLS is the data itself. We get our data from Opta, and this is what Opta defines as possession: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the game, the passes for each team are totaled up, and then each team’s total is divided by the game total to produce a percentage figure which shows the percentage of the game that each team has accrued in possession of the ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Possession” in Opta’s data is thus a measure of the proportion of completed passes in a match for each team, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;a proportion of time. A lot of short, quick passes will accrue possession for a team that may only have the ball for a matter of seconds. This isn’t necessarily bad or good. It is what it is, and we’ll work with it.  Not all passes are created equally—-or better put, not all teams’ passes average out to be equally effective—-but for a moment let’s suppose that they are. It’s hard to gather data on the value of each pass, and hard to then weight teams’ passes accordingly. So let’s just stick with the assumption that all teams’ passes are equally effective. Perhaps someday we can sit around drinking beer and punching holes in that assumption. Today is not that day. Under that assumption of equal passes, a team that completes a higher proportion of passes than its opponent will likely have strung together effective buildup more often than its opponent. Having created more effective build up, that team will likely have earned more scoring opportunities than its opponent. Having earned more scoring opportunities than its opponent, that team will be more likely to score goals and nab points. So this sort of possession should really imply sunshine and rainbows for the participating team. Seems like fair logic to me, but of course, I’m the one writing. Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/&quot;&gt;tables&lt;/a&gt;—tables that were created with Opta’s version of possession, remember—we don’t see a strong correlation between possession and results. Four of the top five teams (by points per match) have 50% possession or less, but overall there is still a weakly &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;positive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; correlation. We start to get significant results when we assess the correlations between teams’ possession and Attempt Ratios (0.60&lt;em&gt;), and again with Shots on Goal Ratios (0.55&lt;/em&gt;). Those positive correlations imply that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;more possession&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; coincides with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;more scoring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;chances.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Of course, there is not nececelery a causal link. Let’s take a look at this from another perspective. If we look at the relationships &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;game-by-game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;—rather than &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;team-by-team&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;—the correlation between possession and scoring chances is still positive. The team that possesses the ball for a majority of passes (Opta’s definition) during any given match also tends to earn more scoring attempts than its opponent. So far I’ve bored you with support for conventional wisdom: possession coincides with more scoring opportunities, and thus probably with better results. But then I control for a few variables and shit goes haywire. When I control for each individual team and whether or not they were playing at home, the relationship between possession and results is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;decidedly negative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, a team that possesses the ball an additional 10% in any given match is expected to lose half of a goal on average, equivalent to about half of a point. For example’s sake, consider the Seattle &lt;del&gt;Flounders&lt;/del&gt; Sounders. Over Seattle’s top four matches in terms of possession, it has earned just one point. However, during Seattle’s bottom four matches in terms of possession, it has earned eight points. Seattle is an extreme case, but a good example of what my model is picking up. Most teams individually seem to do worse when their possession is higher. So more possession seems to correlate with more shots, and more shots seems to correlate with more goals, but for some reason more possession does not share a significant relationship with more goals. There is some missing information screwing with me, and I don’t have a definitive explanation for this strange paradox, but I will share a theory. Each team has a style. Whether or not that style works is probably mostly a product of how well the players fit in, and how good those players are in the first place. Perhaps, in general, a style that focuses more on stringing short passes together tends to produce more shots than a high-risk/high-reward style, but this type of possession is not a necessary condition for success. Once each team develops its style, a certain amount of possession is required to optimize that style. For Montreal, it may be 49% possession, and for Portland, it might be 57%. This would explain the mild positive correlations between possession and shots &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;across teams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. But why is it that, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;across games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, more possession seems to correspond to less goals and worse results? In a given game, if a team generates more possession—more passing by Opta’s definition—then perhaps that is indicative more of the opponent’s defense than of the desire of the team in question to possess. In other words, an excellent defense may not necessarily kill possession, but rather, push possession to less dangerous parts of the pitch. In this way, more possession is simply indicative of a frustrated team, not a team in control doing what it wants to do. Without being able to conclude this thought exercise satisfyingly, I will propose a few things. First, that by charting each shot’s point of origin, we can begin to assess the quality of a team’s shots. And second, that possession data should be gathered from the distinct areas on the pitch. Possession in the attacking third is likely more valuable than possession in the defensive third. Some combination of these two measurements could very well help to explain the paradox we’re seeing with passing possession and team success. *A perfect positive correlation would be 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/possession-confusion/#33&quot; title=&quot;2013-06-13 13:24:52&quot;&gt;David Stringer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; A really interesting read. I don’t really follow the MLS, but a few things come to mind, based in England: Stoke City’s game plan is largely based around set pieces and getting the ball forward quickly - the latter means that their approach is one that deliberately sacrifices possession. I’ve read in a few places that Stoke still haven’t had more than 50% in a game in all the time they’ve been in the Premier League. The stereotypical last gasp, desperate defending will see a team defending a one goal lead in the dying minutes whacking the ball clear anywhere and sitting back with a tight defence, while the attacking team keep possession abd probe. And of course the ability to doggedly pick up underserved wins is a vital skill - it’s a large part of what’s seperated Manchester United from Arsenal in the last few years, but is hard to spot statistically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/possession-confusion/#34&quot; title=&quot;2013-06-13 17:46:20&quot;&gt;Matthias Kullowatz&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Might you agree, then, that during a game in which Stoke City records an abnormally high amount of possession (say 49.5%), that could be because they are not actually playing their style? Or perhaps that it’s simply indicative of the state of the game? A winning squad probably spends the last 15 minutes booting the ball back down the pitch, sacrificing possession because it doesn’t need it. That one actually makes a lot of sense to me now that I think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New England Revolution Acquire Juan Agudelo, What Does That Mean?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First things first before I make fun of the Revolution (and I will).  Their defense has been—-excluding the New York outlier—-borderline elite this season. That’s possibly one of the few reasons they’re still afloat and maybe the only reason to watch them (sorry, Lee Nguyen).  &lt;a href=&quot;http://tempofreesoccer.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Tempo-free soccer&lt;/a&gt; has the Revs ranked 6th in dAG (defensive attempts on goals), which is how many times an opposing team has made any attempt at their goal. Add to that that we have them ranked 2nd (6.2%) in Opposing Finishing%, which is how often a team’s opponents successfully convert attempts into actual goals. They’re better than every team outside of Montreal in that category. This has all culminated in only 6 goals allowed in 9 games. Something that would be overlooked if it wasn’t for their horrible attack and the need for at least some positive mention. But now the Revs have added the young (former starlett?) Juan Agudelo, someone who saw time with the US National team only 6 months ago in Russia and didn’t look awful by any stretch. To be fair, he’s someone that has actually come out looking very strong for Chivas earlier this season, but he’s been hampered the last few weeks with hamstring issues. It was thought that he had mended a brewing off-season situation between himself and Chivas USA head coach, El Chelis. But of late, Chelis has given a lot of credit to his now former striker. He told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdchivasusa.com/news/2013/03/chelis-admits-i-didnt-know-what-i-had-juan-agudelo&quot;&gt;MLSSoccer&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t know what I had in Agudelo, but by having him, what I asked for doesn’t matter because Agudelo is a model. He is the natural on this team. He’s a player that has many technical qualities. He’s very involved in working to improve others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now he’s shipped off to the greater Boston area and &lt;del&gt;we are with out the full detail of the acquisition being yet to be vented &lt;/del&gt; in exchange the Goats received &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sounderatheart.com/2012/12/23/3797066/allocation-money&quot;&gt;allocation money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The spice of life and magic dust that no one talks about and everyone wants. Of course for us this isn’t about the details at this point. What Juan Agudelo will bring is spectacular things and then all together frustrating things. He averages about 16 shots on goal per 1500 minutes, a number he has yet to reach in either of his stops in Chivas or New York. A team averages a goal on 9.4% of its attempts this season, and 26.9% of its shots on goal. Using that, there’s a possibility that he adds a few additional goals to the line-up. Assuming he is just average at finishing. That said Agudelo has beat the average ratio over his 3,000 minutes, scoring 11 goals in 36 shots on goal (30.6%). Scoring goals is a skill, and though we don’t know how much is luck vs. his ability, I think it’s very possible that he will continue to beat the league average conversion rates. Looking at &lt;strong&gt;Chris Wondolowski&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Kenny Cooper&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Álvaro Saborío&lt;/strong&gt;--the top 3 scorers for 2012—they all combined to beat the league average by scoring a goal on 43.9% of their shots on target. So, we can safely attribute scoring goals on shots on target as being a skill, the only problem is trying to account for luck. That’s a little difficult at this stage, and so for now, we’ll just mention it. But assuming that Agudelo is consistent and continues scoring at a high rate and matches 1500 minutes. I have him for about 6 goals this season. Right now considering their goal conversion and their already abysmal offense, the Revs are on pace for 36 goals total to end the season. Considering their ability to suppress their opponent’s talent and ability to score goals I have them for 26 goals allowed, assuming they continue their defensive supremacy. Using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccermetrics.net/soccer-pythagorean-theory/new-soccer-pythagorean-api-call&quot;&gt;SoccerMetricsPythagorean&lt;/a&gt; this comes out at about 51 points… given the asinine goal difference. Add in the additional 6 goals that Juan Agudelo brings and that brings them to a total of 56. Basically almost a full point for each goal. Now, I’m not about to say that the Revolution have a shot at 60 points, not in your life. But in the last 3 years the only teams to have a plus goal differential AND not make the playoffs were 2011 Chicago Fire and the 2010 Kansas City Wizards. Considering a team-wide return to a league-average ability to score goals AND adding Juan Agudelo, it’s very possible that New England just moved themselves within striking distance for the 4th or 5th spot in the East. Columbus and Philly, beware.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Game of the Week Recap: Dynamo at Galaxy</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/houston-dynamo-la-galaxy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles Galaxy’s Landon Donovan blew a PK in the 25th minute, and the Houston Dynamo managed a goal in the 56th, stealing three points in LA. Definitely not what our expert panel of misfits projected on &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/05/05/asa-podcast-episode-five/&quot;&gt;Saturday’s podcast&lt;/a&gt;.  The Galaxy controlled possession (59.3%), won more duels (55%), and earned more attempts (19 to 14), but earned nothing in the standings for its work. Here’s a chronological summary of Houston’s shots:  &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/houston-dynamo-shot-times-may-5-2013.png&quot; alt=&quot;Houston Dynamo shot times - May 5 2013&quot;&gt; There are actually two shots taken in succession there before Houston’s opponent missed a PK, but the disproportionate bulk of Houston’s shots, including its goal, still came after it almost went down 1-0. That’s probably just random, but interesting nonetheless. Here’s something that’s almost surely not random. Though the Galaxy won the attempts battle, many of those attempts were blocked, and many of those blocked attempts occurred after Houston took the lead. Observe: &lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/la-galaxys-blocked-shot-times-may-5-2013.png&quot; alt=&quot;LA Galaxy&amp;#39;s blocked shot times - May 5 2013&quot;&gt; It seems the Galaxy began to get desperate, and this brings up the concept of game states which we discussed in the above podcast. Teams are likely to employ different strategies depending on the score of the game. While the Galaxy out-attempted the Dynamo during the game, many of those attempts appear to have been of the low-probability type. The Dynamo jumped up to third in points per game, and the updated tables can now be seen &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;em&gt;*Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2013-05-05-LA-v-HOU/chalkboard&quot;&gt;Opta and MLS Soccer&lt;/a&gt; for the sweet images!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Game States: An Attempt at an Introduction</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/game-states-an-introduction/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/game-states-an-introduction/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m no mathematician. Matty maybe, but I am not. So when approaching something like Game States, I felt it good to attempt to introduce it with something, though it’s rather ominous and a bit intimidating. So most—if not all—of the information provided is taken from a source who is smarter than I am. That’s really what this blog is all about, finding people who know and understand the principles we are trying to learn and centralize the material and keep it in tidy location where people that are new—-not just to the sport, but also the concept of analytics—-can go to find information and grow their knowledge.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~sklar/teaching/s09/cis3.5/hw/labIII.3.pdf&quot;&gt;The idea of game states&lt;/a&gt; is that a match will consist of a sequence of states, where each state is defined by a combination or series of events that culminate in creating a new state. Those events give details and help break down the match. They provide context or meaning to the data that we record. Game states, as I understand it, is based upon the idea of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain&quot;&gt;Markov Chains&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;…[A] mathematical system that undergoes transitions from one state to another, between a finite or countable number of possible states. It is a random process usually characterized as memoryless: the next state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s apply this idea to a sport…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In football, if a team is in a certain situation, what happened previously has no effect on what will happen next. For example, if we have a 1st-and-10 from our own 20, it does not matter if the previous play was a kickoff for a touchback or a 10-yard gain for a first down after a 3rd-and-10 from the 10-yardline. Either way, we now have a new situation that will only directly affect the next play.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it all into soccer terminology, if a team has possession of the ball and is progressing past the half-line and into the attacking third it doesn’t matter if they got it on an interception or a goal kick. Regardless of how it happened they now have the ball going into the oppositions attacking third and will have an opportunity to threaten and score. I struggle with this thought because tactically this may not be true—-an individual getting the ball on a break is different than someone participating with a soft building of play in attacking the opposition’s net. Coming from a statistical and memory-less position we simply want the facts. Let’s go to another sport and put this into baseball terms because of the advanced progress that the sport in general has made in analytics. Baseball analytics breaks game states down into four basic concepts: &lt;strong&gt;the score, inning, base runners and outs&lt;/strong&gt;. This would be the way you could &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lookoutlanding.com/2010/2/14/1310724/sabremetrics-101-the-game-state&quot;&gt;calculate basic run/win expectancy and ratios&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have the average number of runs expected to score in an inning after any game state, you can figure out how many runs a stolen base is worth, or a triple, or a strikeout. The game state essentially allows us to relate everything that happens on the diamond back to the major currencies of baseball: winning and runs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not talking about baseball. We’re talking about soccer, or for you euro snobs, ‘Fútbol’. However, taking the concepts of an already practically applied matrix, such as baseball and the one that that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tangotiger.net/RE9902.html&quot;&gt;Tom Tango has already developed(see below),&lt;/a&gt; can give us ideas on how we can attempt to create a corresponding one in soccer. Soccer has &lt;strong&gt;wins&lt;/strong&gt; too—-though I see more people associate points—-but our true currency in this sport is &lt;strong&gt;goals&lt;/strong&gt;. Everything leads back to the price or value of a goal. Whether it be a cross or a tackle, the ultimate result of what we want is to be able to understand how things work together to produce goals.Comparing the possible game states; Soccer just—just like in baseball—has a score line that can help give us an idea of the transitions between states. A team being up one goal, or on the other side of the coin being down one goal, can give us a definition of a game state. It’s simplistic, but it works. It also can show us why some times, looking at you Alex Fergueson, teams take less shots than at other times. It would make sense just for the purpose of proper possession. We also have measurement for the length of the game, in that each team will play against one another for a total of 90 minutes. In soccer, we have &lt;strong&gt;time intervals&lt;/strong&gt;. The largest problem is that because it’s constantly moving rather than a set static state, such as an inning, it creates a lot of various probabilities and chains. However, if you wanted to mitigate that to an extent you could instead just revert to the basics of using the first half vs. the second half of a match. While these are two big time intervals, when used in conjunction with other specific game states it could continue to help us develop a better understanding of the game. The next one listed is base runners, but I’m going to pass on that and move on to the concept of &lt;strong&gt;outs&lt;/strong&gt;. This is something that at very best I can say is a difficult correlation, but if you wanted to attempt one I might try changes in possession. This is a rather poor concept and I have no idea how or if you want to use this… probably not. Baseball limits a team to three attempts to score per their half of the inning rather than having 3 specific possessions or attempts to score. In the first 45 minutes of a half you could have a team with anywhere between 12 and 40 possessions alone depending on who the opponent was and how the team executed its attack. Back to &lt;strong&gt;base runners,&lt;/strong&gt; and this is one of the easier things to mimic though I have no way of proving how closely they are related. Shots on goal  conceivably could give us a baseline on the probability of goal scored and, more importantly, the points that are associated with winning or drawing. One additional game state that hasn’t been mentioned and doesn’t really correlate with anything that baseball has, is &lt;strong&gt;yellow and red cards&lt;/strong&gt;. While, baseball has ejections it doesn’t necessarily affect the dimensions of the game. However, in soccer it puts the team down a man, rather than being able to just sub in a replacement. These are all elements which you would consider &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt;. How do teams perform during these situations? Do their possessions last longer? Do they take more shots? What are the quality of shots? This is the information and really the purpose behind gathering the data points. Are the Seattle Sounders just as likely to score in a “-1” goal situation as they are in a tie-game? This is all information that we are seeking. The context can provide further details as well as specific entry into how certain aspects and statistics can be properly correlated to goals, and then to points toward the table. I feel like there is more to write about here… and that’s because it’s true. There is a lot more to write about. But this is primarily to cover the basics of game states. We’ll talk more about it in our podcast tomorrow, and we’ll have a follow up post to everything when we start preparing to post MLS game state information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/game-states-an-introduction/#143&quot; title=&quot;2013-11-13 00:21:43&quot;&gt;Ken Krauss&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Very interesting concept! I will be thinking about this for a long time. You allude to it but don’t outright say it — where the players are on the field is part of the game state. Not only that, but where the ball is in relation to the rest of the team. If the most advanced player on the field has the ball it is going to be a different state than if a midfielder has the ball or a defender because many different options (transitions to other states) are going to be available to the players based on where they are on the field and where the other players on their team and the opposing team are on the field. Score, time on the clock, and cards issued are also going to affect game state, and so is fatigue and substitutions used but maybe to a lesser degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/game-states-an-introduction/#146&quot; title=&quot;2013-11-13 02:05:16&quot;&gt;Harrison Crow&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Matthias and I have talked a lot about conditional or state based analysis. Specifically we’ve talked about it in regards to passing and creating a metric that would take into account the distance the pass traveled, how many players were around when it was received, how many were around when it was sent, what was the score, where on the pitch was it sent and where did it come from. There is so much more to be explored with passing that I can’t wait until we have that at our disposal to develop that analysis. That said, I agree with you, game states and conditional analysis is the future of what we do. CONTEXT!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Now, A Thought On Big Data And Club Analysis</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/now-a-thought-on-big-data-and-club-analyst/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/now-a-thought-on-big-data-and-club-analyst/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I talked a bit about Big vs. Small data last week—in case you missed it, &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/data-big-vs-small/&quot;&gt;go back and check it out&lt;/a&gt;--and we kind of talked about how you don’t have to necessarily rely on the revolution of big data. There is a need to make do with what is currently available. However, for many clubs overseas that big data is available, but there are other encumbrances to deal with: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the complexity and time constraints placed on the analysis, another major obstacle faced in the job – like that faced by so many people entrusted with big data within an organisation, football club or otherwise – is to make data useful, accessible and engaging to colleagues who have little interest or experience in dealing with numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This from a recent&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebigdatainsightgroup.com/site/article/ben-smith-development-performance-systems-chelsea-fc&quot;&gt; interview with Ben Smith of the development performance systems at Chelsea FC&lt;/a&gt;. A club that is often quoted as one of the “big-4” in the English Premier League. It’s important to understand that, while many of these clubs have information at their disposal, few (if any) know or understand the practicality of implementing the information into their planning and preparation phase. If fact, reading back on the ‘Counter Attack’ blog by Richard Whittal, some clubs—i.e. most— &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/now-a-thought-on-big-data-and-club-analyst/even%20pay%20their%20club%20analysts&quot;&gt;don’t pay their club analysts&lt;/a&gt;. That should give you a brief, if not all together insulting, view of how much they respect the value of the service provided. I’m not saying they don’t see it as useful in “some capacity”, I just think that, in terms of how much they pay the rest of the staff, they could afford to have a full time analyst, especially for what an analyst has the potential to provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is not, of course, just the coaching and scouting staff that benefit from the big data analytics being carried out at the club, the players are also reaping the rewards of the work across the club. He says: “Every one of Chelsea’s Academy players from the age of nine has a personalised development programme.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some interesting stuff here to think about. It sounds a lot like how &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/analyseFooty&quot;&gt;Ravi Ramineni&lt;/a&gt; has started helping out David Tenney, Sounders FC fitness coach, over the past 6-8 months. By the way, h/t goes to Ravi who linked the article from his twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Game Of The Week Recap: New England Revolution vs. Philadaelphia Union</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s Monday morning! Hope you’ve had your coffee, been to your morning meetings and are ready to catch up on the MLS weekend. We’re not probably at the point to where we’re going to review games or teams on a consistent basis. That’s not really our thing… at least, not yet. But Saturday on the most recent podcast, Matty and I talked about our game of the week, featuring the New England Revolution at home versus a high powered Philadelphia attack. The Union boys are a club that, in general, doesn’t keep possession long, nor win it back. But they rely specifically on creating as many chances as possible and finishing the ones they are supposed too. It’s partially why they are an improved club this year and one that has a legit chance to get into the playoffs and do some damage in the East. They were coming up against a New England team that averaged less ball possession, won the ball back less and took a whole lot less shots—-and the Revolution was even allowing its opponents twice as many opportunities as it earned for itself. What it came down to was that Philly was a borderline good team that sat near mid-table, and New England was arguably one of the worst-seeded among those in the bottom. The surprising thing, and partly what made us choose this game as our game of the week, was simply how split the analysts were at MLSsoccer.com. Two were for a draw, two for a Union win, and two had the Rev’s with a win. All the way around it was kind of an interesting match-up of a slumping team against a club that seemed to be on it’s way up. If you didn’t hear the podcast, I had the Union 2-1, and Matty went even further with a 2-0 Union beating on the road in Foxborough. Both of us look a little silly this morning with the Revolution pulling out the win. So, how exactly did this band of struggling MLS misfits steal 3-points? Simple, they finally took and finished shots. The first capture below is the Revs and their chances created in the attacking third. This is shots, key passes and corner kicks and successful free-kicks leading to attempts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/revsattackingthird-20130427.jpeg?w=300&quot; alt=&quot;RevsAttackingThird-20130427&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next shot is clearances, interceptions, recoveries, tackles, blocks, saves and punches made by the the keeper/back defensive four of the Union inside their own box… it’s kind of a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/uniond-201304271.jpeg?w=300&quot; alt=&quot;UnionD-20130427&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that for the first time, possibly all season, the Revolution were dangerous on the attack and they not only put shots on target, they legitimately tested the opposing defense. Then, once they had a lead, they allowed their strong defense to carry them home for the full 3 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost as convicting, the Union were only able to create 6 real attempts on goal in the second half and only 4 after the Rev’s finally broke the stalemate. While they weren’t bad on the attacking end, it just simply didn’t match what the home team was accomplishing, and it left Philly out points at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this sort of game underlines the amount of parity that is in this league right now and also the fact that you have to consider a team’s incredibly poor finishing rate as &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; being an indication of true talent—-at least, not this early in the season. New England basically out-Union’d the Union, by beating them while playing their own style of play on the pitch. Overwhelming them with shots and finishing opportunities. Both teams will face exceptionally tough tasks by playing Northwest clubs (Portland and Seattle, respectively) next week, and it should be interesting to see what comes of it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Montreals Paradox</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/montreals-paradox/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have listened to our podcasts or read through our stuff, you will have heard us talk about shot ratios a lot. That’s how many shots a team gets divided by how many shots its allows its opponents. A shot ratio of 1.5, for example, means that a team gets one-and-a-half times as many shots as its opponents. When soccer teams create extra opportunities for themselves, it generally leads to more goals and more points in the standings. And then there’s Montreal. The Montreal Impact has been something of a Cinderella story this season, at least statistically. Leading up to its matchup with the Chicago Fire on Saturday, the Impact had recorded the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;second-worst&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; shot attempt ratio in the entire league. Montreal had earned just 61 shot attempts with 28 on target to its opponents’ 95 shot attempts with 32 on target.  Yet somehow, the Impact had maintained a positive goal differential (+2) and the second-most points per match right behind FC Dallas. Against Chicago, Montreal not only won on the scoreboard two-nil, it also won the shooting and possession battles. But that is a rare feat this year for the Impact, and it’s worth posing the question: Has Montreal been lucky this season, or does it do things that shot ratios and possession just can’t explain? Using just &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;shots on goal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for now, I regressed goal scoring ratios against shot ratios to see how teams “should do,” as if shots on goal were the only thing that matter. Even this early in the season, the regression was not all that bad (R2 = 0.4). It also said that Montreal’s 0.94 &lt;em&gt;shot&lt;/em&gt; ratio should lead to about the same &lt;em&gt;goal&lt;/em&gt; ratio.&lt;em&gt; Well that makes sense. If you generate roughly the same number of shots on target as your opponents, you should score about the same number of goals. The Impact, however, have scored nine goals to its opponents’ five—a 1.8 ratio, or +4 differential, if you prefer. An obvious thing to consider is finishing rate. Despite being outshot, the Impact players finish their attempts with goals &lt;em&gt;*&lt;em&gt;more than twice as efficiently &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;as opponents do. That ratio is the best in the league. My first instinct is that the Impact has been somewhat lucky, and that opponents will start to finish with more frequency. But there are two possible explanations I want to explore first before waving the cliché luck flag: the quality of opportunities for Montreal and the quality of opportunities for its opponents. Harrison talked a little bit about Montreal’s counter-attacking style during a recent podcast, and there’s a possibility that the Impact’s style allows low-quality opportunities to its opponents, leading to higher-percentage opportunities for itself on the counter attack. (Before we investigate, it should be noted that Montreal’s schedule has featured teams that average out to be, well, league-average when it comes to finishing.) Let’s take Saturday’s match against the Fire as an example of the tools I’m using. Check out the Opta chalkboard for yourself &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2013-04-27-MTL-v-CHI/chalkboard&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and you can see from where teams are shooting and scoring by clicking the appropriate boxes for team and statistic of interest. During this particular game, I have Montreal down for 16 scoring attempts, nine from outside the box, six inside, and one from right on the edge. Both its goals were scored from inside the box (though you could argue one was one the edge). Chicago, on the other hand, earned 11 attempts, ripping seven of those from outside the box, just two from inside, and two from the edge of the box. Chicago did not score. I did this for each of Montreal’s seven games this season. Obviously things like angle matter, too, but I’m not going to pull out my protractor for this one. Here’s the breakdown for Montreal and its opponents on the season: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attempts&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Goals&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Finishing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stat&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Montreal&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Opponents&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Montreal&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Opponents&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Montreal&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Opponents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside Box&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;40&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;45&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15.0%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8.9%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside Box&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;31&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;56&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9.7%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.8%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Edge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.0%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.0%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;77&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;106&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.7%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.7%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Montreal earns more shots inside the box than outside, and that might very well be a product of its system and players, rather than just dumb luck. While the Impact is being outshot in total, perhaps that stat is skewed slightly by shot selection. Montreal’s system seems to create a greater proportion of opportunities in the box. I would still expect some regression from Montreal this season back toward the middle of the standings—as its shot ratios are not favorable even after adjusting for quality—but perhaps not as far as a simple shot model would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s Saturday and time to drop yet another American Soccer Analysis Podcast on you all. As we’ve been previewing this past week, we’re going to talk a bit about some of the up and coming MLS rookies that have played a big role on their teams to this point in the season. We’ll add in our thoughts on using a Plus/Minus statistic for measuring individual performance, as well as our selection for game of the week. Hope you enjoy.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow during our podcast we’ll be talking a bit about rookies, some of our thoughts on their various seasons at this juncture, and how we rack and stack them. Here are a few short profiles on the ones we’ll be talking about… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CARLOS ALVAREZ, MIDFIELDER - CHIVAS USA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez does a lot of things really well. He’s rotated through a few different positions in the midfield for El Chelis this season and his accumulated stats kind of reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though interesting enough, for as up-and-down as the attack is, Alvarez hasn’t touched the ball as much as you think. At only 8.62% of his teams touches, he hasn’t been as involved in the total care of the ball.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Soccer, Plus-Minus System Ideas</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/soccer-plus-minus-system-ideas/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/soccer-plus-minus-system-ideas/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s late and I have no intention of staying up past midnight for another night only to be woken by my darling, love-of-my-life, three year old at 6 o’clock wanting to play angry birds. That all said, I have been messing around with collecting various Opta data on &lt;strong&gt;Deshorn Brown&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;DeAndre Yedlin&lt;/strong&gt; for our upcoming Saturday podcast that is going to talk specifically about limited data analysis and cross positional rankings. Without giving away too much, it gave me an idea for a plus-minus system that could potentially work if balanced correctly. There are basic good things and bad things that occur on the pitch during the 90. Most of those things, those that involve the ball, are recorded by Opta. If you could somehow weight those events and come up with a system that associates a value to them, then you could potentially have a system that inherently grades players for how they perform on the ball across the board. What if you associated a key pass being worth a one-third what a goal is worth, being that a third of key passes lead to goals. Maybe a clearance or block is worth—-whatever that associated average is with preventing goals from being scored. Somewhere there could be a point scale that is attributed based upon how many times those events occur on average between goal scoring events and in game states. Matty has a nice little utility that he’ll be presenting soon in regards game states. It should, to undersell it a bit, be grand and possibly allow for these events to be contextualized and valued in a more meaningful capacity. I don’t know—maybe I’m drunk with coffee and in need of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/soccer-plus-minus-system-ideas/#145&quot; title=&quot;2013-11-13 00:51:49&quot;&gt;Ken Krauss&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; I think we need to start measuring distances passed and dribbled, and maybe distances of passes received. The trick is to figure out how to weight the negative and wide ball movement compared to the movement straight at the goal. Working through these concepts is the purpose of my blog, so please stop by and leave your thoughts on what I have posted so far. Also important is the rate of turnovers a player has. I also think we can apply the concept of an unforced error to soccer as well. Being able to say a player had 600 yards of passing in a game, 250 yards of dribbling, a turnover rate of .28, and made 1 error in addition to the traditional stats like goals, shots, assists, tackles, and blocked shots would be very informative and insightful into player performance. Since every ball movement on the field is going to equate into movement in an (x,y) grid, we can calculate how much each ball movement actually moves the ball down field or towards goal. There are two measures I can think of that are important as far as distances on the field go: one measuring straight down the field and straight across it, and the other as a series of arcs around the goal mouth measuring distance from the goal line in the goal to the ball. I think both are important and so we need to come up with some sort of averaged distance using both measures for each pass and each dribbling action. I also think keeping track of the negative and wide movement is important too since this motion helps open up spaces in other parts of the field. Obviously it’s more important to move the ball closer to goal because your team isn’t going to score unless you get the ball near the goal but you can’t just go straight down the field without mixing it up and kicking it out wide or occasionally turning it around to relieve pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/soccer-plus-minus-system-ideas/#149&quot; title=&quot;2013-11-13 14:29:43&quot;&gt;Matthias Kullowatz&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; I think with the right data, the value of a wide pass, for instance, could be estimated. The issue is context. Getting too specific on context means that each situation lives in its own sample size of 1. Being not specific enough means that there are confounding variables at play. I think knowing how many defenders are behind the ball for each pass and dribble, and the proximity of the closest defender to the ball, would provide good, quantitative context without. I like your thought about how the (x,y) grid system would need to account for those cases that the ball is close to goal. “Forward” doesn’t have the same meaning anymore in the attacking third.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Opta Loosens The Chains A Bit</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/opta-loosen-the-chains-a-bit/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/opta.jpeg?w=240&quot; alt=&quot;opta&quot;&gt; Look it’s late, you’ll have to forgive the choppy .jpeg job above. I have no idea why I’m up besides the fact that I don’t have to go to work in the morning. But with the upswing of free time, I’m just corralling the internet and generally reviewing information that I often don’t find time to cruise through. While sifting through data and spending my time nodding off to sleep at my key board, I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.optasports.com/en/playground-section.aspx&quot;&gt;Opta’s playground&lt;/a&gt; site where they are “opening up the database”. I’m not sure how new this is or if it is just something I missed. But I know it wasn’t available the last time I was around. It’s a basic request for &lt;del&gt;people&lt;/del&gt; nerds like me (and possibly you…) to submit data requests. An understatement would be to call this development “cool”. A lot of data within Soccer is closed off and generally leaves a lot to be desired. Being a guy that used to write a lot about baseball, it would be awful—strickly speaking from my perspective—to write about a player if the lack of overall information that was provide is akin to that of modern day soccer data. It’s safeguarded and looked after as if it was top secret defense information. To be fair, I actually think that some of that information is kept more secure than defense information. But that’s not really the subject. Having the ability to submit an e-mail request for specific data is exciting. It’s a marked improved over the current status-que. Sure, you could complain about the fact that they only accept one application in all categories per e-mail address, but who cares it’s an improvement and here, that’s what we’re all about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data, Big vs. Small</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/data-big-vs-small/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/data-big-vs-small/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We talk and we talk about the need for more information to solve some of the problems and general questions that we have as a collective community within Soccer Analytics. Today I ran across a general post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2013/apr/25/forget-big-data-small-data-revolution&quot;&gt;Big Data and the revolution that is really small data&lt;/a&gt;. It lead me back to thinking about some of the discussions that Matthias (apparently he has a real name), Keith (the missing guy in the podcasts), and I have had prior and outside of the podcasting realms. It’s not always about waiting to develop thoughts or theories until you have data, but making do with what you have at your current disposal and developing theories that later—with further advances—you can prove or disprove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as we now find it ludicrous to talk of “big software” – as if size in itself were a measure of value – we should, and will one day, find it equally odd to talk of “big data”. Size in itself doesn’t matter – what matters is having the data, of whatever size, that helps us solve a problem or address the question we have.  - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2013/apr/25/forget-big-data-small-data-revolution&quot;&gt;Rufus Pollock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that anyone is or is not doing this… it just seemed really profound after a cup a coffee and two shots of espresso, that I thought I’d mention it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Post About Possession Stats</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First of all, I had intended to have this up this past weekend and not on Thursday, my apologies. Secondly, I hope you all went out and looked at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/mls-tables/&quot;&gt;stat table&lt;/a&gt; that Matty put together. Some great accumulation of data and in a nice little format and summary that follows it. Great information and some stuff that isn’t readily available anywhere else. Consume this stat heads. This past weekend during our recording session we talked about possession. This has been talked and written about time, and time again by people much smarter than myself. I won’t waste a lot of my own words except to kind of bring things together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;get more (much more) after the jump&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham MacAree, wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weaintgotnohistory.com/2012/4/22/2966747/possession-analysis-football-statistics&quot;&gt;brilliant piece about Opta stats&lt;/a&gt; and how they specifically calculate possession as a whole. To save you a bit of time, the summation of the finding is that Opta, at the time, calculates possession as pass volume. Meaning if you take the entire amount of pass attempts over the 90’ minutes and divide that against each of the sides pass attempts you would get the reported amount of “possession”. &lt;a href=&quot;http://prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com/2012/04/23/opta-possession-stat-not-based-on-time-on-number-of-passes/&quot;&gt;Richard Farely&lt;/a&gt; does a great summation on why that’s bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? Let’s take a totally fake scenario. Barcelona plays three quick passes before trying a through ball that rolls to Petr Cech. It all takes four seconds, while Petr Cech keeps the ball at his feet for eight seconds before picking it up, holding it for five seconds, then putting it out for a throw in, which takes eight more seconds to put back into play. Despite Barcelona having possession for only four of those 25 fake seconds, they’d have 80 percent of Opta’s possession (three good passes plus one bad, while Chelsea had only Cech’s unsuccessful pass). A logical expectation of a zero-sum possession figure would have that as either 16 percent or (if you credit the time out of play as Barça’s, since they’d have the ensuing throw) 48 percent Barcelona’s. Or, if you do a three-stage model (that’s sometimes reported in Serie A matches), you’d have 16 percent Barcelona, 52 percent Chelsea, and 32 percent limbo/irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I say “at the time” because I attempted to do that tonight and my math was a bit off. So it’s possible they also incorporate another statistic or something a long those lines. It’s highly unlikely that they have gone towards a game clock as they still report in percentages. Now it’s fair to argue that the possession stat is meaningless, as &lt;strong&gt;[Rui Xu&lt;/strong&gt;](&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rui_xu&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/rui_xu&lt;/a&gt;) (follow him on twitter, seriously, do it now) of Sporting Kansas City Performance and Statistical Analytics department thinks the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I think they’re useless because they don’t contain any context. There is little-to-no correlation with points (if anything, there’s a slightly negative correlation in the MLS), and it doesn’t really tell you anything on a performance analysis level. Once you start adding context is when you’ll be able to draw some narratives. What is the possession percentage of the road team after they go up 1-0?  What was it before?  What is the possession percent of the home team when up 2-0 after the 80th minute?  You still have to be very, very cautious though.  -&lt;strong&gt;[ Numerology: How valuable is possession anyway?&lt;/strong&gt;](&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mlssoccer.com/numerology/news/article/2012/06/21/numerology-figuring-out-where-theres-value-field&quot;&gt;http://www.mlssoccer.com/numerology/news/article/2012/06/21/numerology-figuring-out-where-theres-value-field&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, it’s countered very well by the Revolutions Timothy Crawford. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to say exactly what possession necessarily does at this point. Barcelona out-possesses everyone, but they certainly dropped some points and big matches. There have been studies that have shown teams that win often lose the possession battle, but as my statistics classes taught me, correlation does not necessarily imply causation. No one is saying the way to win more matches is to never have the ball. It’s trying to find what part of possession is important, and then applying that to tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, there is a mass amount of information that has basically flooded our ability to start analyzing the American version of “the beautiful game,” and guess what, we’re going to turn it into 1’s and 0’s because we’re all a bunch of Yankee bastards.  But as we do that there are going to be plenty of things that we don’t know. I’m not sold that Possession is useless, but I can’t think of exactly what is needed to make it “good” or what “good” it could produce at distant point in the future. Matthias at a certain point on our podcast mentioned specific time spent in attack or in the opposing third, versus the ball residing in your own defensive third.These things of course matter as they will eventually create opportunities for you or your opponent. That leads into the thought that not every chance on goal is documented by a shot. There are plenty of these that stopped just short by defenders or goal keepers making last ditch efforts. That being said if you sit inside and lob in crosses hoping to get luck, Charles Reep style, against a team such as San Jose or Los Angeles that is remarkably well versed in protecting such an attack, what does it really matter how much time you had in the attack. You wasted it. That being said, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zonalmarking.net/2012/05/04/the-relationship-between-possession-and-shots/&quot;&gt;Zonal Marking has done some correlative work&lt;/a&gt; between the relation of shots and possessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, there’s a fairly obvious correlation – the more possession you have, the more shots on goal you’re likely to attempt, which is hardly a revelation. The graph is interesting, however, for two reasons. First, because there are clear differences between the five separate leagues. Second, because there’s a handful of sides that don’t fit the pattern, and a lot of variation amongst the sides who see a lot possession. The sides who are significantly ‘higher’ on the graph compared to the line of best fit are particularly efficient with possession – they have more shots than you’d expect for the amount of the ball they enjoy. Those who are significantly ‘lower’ are less efficient – they see a lot of the ball but record relatively few shots on goal. Of course, being more or less efficient is not necessarily ‘better’ – because the sole purpose of possession is not to score a goal. Possession can be used as a defensive tactic to play out time when a side is ahead, and can be used to tire the opposition, before attacking more directly later on. The intention here is not to ‘rank’ sides, but to show their different styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the biggest thing is how he ended those paragraphs “but to show their different styles”. I think the biggest thing that possession shows me, at least for the time being, is what type of team you are. Are you comfortable with the ball or without it? Do you run up-and-down the pitch all day, winning and then losing possession; pressing for that additional chance at goal? Maybe current possession stats can’t tell us all of that information. But looking at break downs and heat maps of possession and the pitch, where players possessed the ball the most, can supply and relate to us an (albeit short) narrative. And ultimately it’s all about context and applying it to the data that we use. Understanding why we chose the data we did and then being able to articulate it back to others, who can point out deficiencies as well as some of it’s strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>American Soccer Analysis – Podcast The Third</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, there, you fine traveller… if you are of a west coast bias you’ll love today’s show. First I have to say I’m really sadden by the fact that neither myself nor Matty worked in a “Third” joke with as much as we like to talk about cutting the field into thirds with this being our third podcast. &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt; it didn’t happen, maybe we’ll save the jokes for episode 33. Anyways… we have the following for you. - We chronicle the life and times of your’s truly, me, Harrison Crow, and little background as to why I created the site - We talk a bit about possession stats, why they’re important, why they are not and how they are sometimes misleading. I referenced a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.optasportspro.com/en/about/optapro-blog/posts/2012/possession%28s%29.aspx&quot;&gt;blog post by Opta&lt;/a&gt; during this conversation… please take a look it has a lot of really good information. I’m trying to come up with a bunch of material for a post later on today. I hope you all check it out. - We do mention Montreal and their Italian influenced defense/counter-attack system and how it’s helped them to a 2nd place start in the Eastern Conference - Next, we chronicle the poor start to the Sounders and why their possession stats are so high, yet have produced no goals. We also mention a bit about Sporting Kansas City and the LA Galaxy, as well as the Portland Timbers and their dominance in possession. - We use the segue of the Portland Timbers to talk a little bit about Will Johnson…underrated pick-up, amazing goals, and his ability to troll on Alan Gordon. Yep, he’s gone for 3 games. Gordon, not Johnson… &lt;img src=&quot;http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BH3q2uOCcAAYBNy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; And for those of you who didn’t catch his brilliant goal, at home, which in turn gave the Timbers 3-points, check it out below: [youtube &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHMV-zPqccc&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHMV-zPqccc&lt;/a&gt;] - Lastly we talked about our “game-of-the-week” which we selected Sporting Kansas City and Los Angeles Galaxy. While separated by 7 points in the table—and more specifically 2 games in hand by LA—-Tempo-Free Soccer has them ranked 1 and 2. We make our picks for who we like, why, and a few little facts to back it up. This podcast is a bit longer than usual at 45 mins, I hope you enjoy!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hope that you all enjoyed your weekend! We’re back with podcast number 2, where Matthias and I discuss a bit about crosses and open-field play in the midfield, and what value they can add to a club. If you care to have a deeper look at some of the numbers, Matty was nice enough to put a piece together should you care to &lt;a href=&quot;http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/mls-crosses-effects/&quot;&gt;take a look&lt;/a&gt;. If not, tune in to the podcast below, hopefully we’ll start bringing some content a long some time in May and there will be more a reason to check back with the site more than once a week.

      <title>The small effects of crossing in MLS</title>
      <link>http://americansocceranalysis.com/articles/mls-crosses-effects/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the podcast that Harrison and I recorded yesterday (to be posted soon), we discussed the value that a midfielder can bring to a team even if he’s not scoring. Harrison brought up, for instance, Mauro Rosales’ crossing ability as a dangerous weapon for the Sounders. The only thing I had to offer to the conversation was data-driven, as I have not seen the Sounders play this season (yes, I unfortunately missed the Timbers-Sounders match). I noticed in the 2013 data that teams that “cross too much” as part of their offenses have tended to fare slightly worse this season. Let me explain the methodology… The game-by-game statistics for “open-play crosses” can be found in all boxscores on mlssoccer.com. An open-play cross is just one that occurs during the run of play, as opposed to free kicks and corner kicks. Crosses can be dangerous, as we’ve seen during the last decade from the German national team specifically, but not every team is the German national team. To isolate the effectiveness of crosses, I started by dividing a team’s crosses by its scoring attempts—scoring attempts being just any shot or attempt in the general direction of the goal. The ratio of crosses to scoring attempts serves as a decent proxy for the fraction of a team’s offense that comes from crosses rather than direct play through the middle. Is it perfect? Of course not, but I hope that this generates some discussion about how to better evaluate the role of crossing in MLS. On to the results! For every game played up through April 6th, I took the home and away teams’ ratios of crosses to goal-scoring attempts. As an example, in the Timbers-Sounders matchup on March 16th, Portland recorded 20 open-play crosses and 13 scoring attempts. Seattle played 9 crosses in, and had just 7 scoring attempts. In both cases, we see that the fraction is actually greater than one. So while this not really a percentage at all, dividing by attempts still helps to control for a teams’ overall offensive production. Portland = 20/13 = 1.54 Seattle = 9/7 = 1.29 Then I take the home team’s ratio and divide by the away team’s ratio. 1.29/1.54 = 0.84 The fact that this number is less than one simply suggests that the home team, the Sounders, used crosses as a smaller proportion of their open-play tactics. Next, I ran a simple linear regression between this final ratio and the goal differential in all matches. Here is the formula: Goal Differential = –0.31 x Ratio + 0.82&lt;em&gt; So what does this mean? Well basically, it says that the more often an MLS home team utilizes crosses, the lower their goal differential tends to be. There are tons of other variables at play in soccer, but let me take a stab at explaining this correlation. Crosses are valid goal-scoring opportunities, and any team would almost always rather get a cross in than, for instance, play the ball all the way back to the defense. But in that same vein, a team would rather attack through the middle and earn a more direct goal scoring opportunity than just whip crosses in all day. So I think what this regression tells us is something that just about every soccer player knows. If a team is forced to constantly play from the wings—if it is forced outside more often than not—its goal-scoring potential will be reduced. Crosses are a necessary part of most offenses simply because a team cannot always get a perfect opportunity in front of the net. Teams that cross a lot may be doing so as part of team tactics, or in any given game it could be an efficient defense that forces the offense to play from the wings. Either way, a weak-but-existent correlation exists that suggests teams should not settle for crosses if possible. I’m sure we haven’t learned anything new here, but I’m a firm believer in attempting to quantify phenomena in sports in an effort to better understand the effect, and to actually measure the size of the effect. _&lt;/em&gt;P-value was 8%, and R-square was 0.05. So this was definitely a weak relationship, and there is more than enough room for certain teams with the right personnel to thrive on crosses. _&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s finally here! If you didn’t get the opportunity to get out to the Sloan Sports Conference out in Boston two months ago—and though I was in town for business, I wasn’t as fortunate to go—the videos from the round table discussions have been posted to YouTube. This is great stuff from some great minds, take a look. [youtube &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ye-mvV9ELI&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ye-mvV9ELI&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re here, we’re loud, we’re here to make a difference. There is a lot to be said within the world of soccer or “futbol”, especially when concerning analysis and analytics. Using what is available is kind of the name of the game. But the thing about American Soccer is that more than ever there is a lot out there that allows for—in the very least—a better way of achieving a whole picture. None of us here have the answers, nor do any of us think we’re going to come up with them. But there are a lot of smart people out there that sometimes go without being heard and our self proclaimed job is finding those people and try to give them a voice and have some fun doing it. We’re going to do a lot of things wrong, moreso than right. That’s cool. You’re going to make mistakes. The point in that is that you make the public you show what you…or we… did wrong and you show you correct or fix that mistake. Giving the process some transparency. Something sorely lacking in American Soccer and Analytics within the beautiful game. For now this is just a site to host our podcasts and generally collect the little bits of wisdom that we’ve scoured the internet for. If you have find something good give me a shout.&lt;/p&gt;
