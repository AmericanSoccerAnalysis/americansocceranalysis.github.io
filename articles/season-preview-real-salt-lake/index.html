          <section class="content"><p>The optimist looks at Real Salt Lake’s 2013 season and praises the club for making the <span class="caps">MLS</span> Cup Finals. The pessimist complains that they lost the MLS Cup Finals in penalty kicks despite holding a lead with 15 minutes remaining, facing a goalkeeper who seemed like his joints had frozen solid. The optimist praises the club’s performance in the U.S. Open Cup, lauding their run to the finals. The pessimist complains that they lost in the finals against DC United, a dreadful team. The optimist praises the team for finishing with a 16-10-8 record and a +16 goal differential in the regular season. The pessimist complains that they failed to win the Supporters Shield (again!) by 3 points. For Real Salt Lake in 2013, perception was everything.  <strong>2013 Finish: 16-10-8, 56 points; 57 <span class="caps">GF</span>, 41 GA. Second place in Western Conference. Lost in MLS Cup&nbsp;Finals.</strong></p>

<strong> Know When to Hold ‘Em</strong> In early 2013, Real Salt Lake owner Dell Loy Hanson made the decision not to extend Jason Kreis’s contract, gambling that Kreis’s stock would come down and he would be able to nab the coach at a bargain price. After all, the club had just lost Will Johnson, Jamison Olave, Fabian Espindola, and Jonny Steele in an offseason filled with cost-cutting moves. 2013 seemed likely to be a rebuilding year. Twelve months and two cup finals later, Jason Kreis is preparing for the 2015 debut of New York City <span class="caps">FC</span>, leaving Jeff Cassar, promoted from assistant coach, to lead Real Salt Lake. Cassar, with the team since 2007, is a safe choice, but even with all 11 starters returning, he may find it difficult to replicate the kind of success that RSL achieved under Jason Kreis. <strong>In Good Hands</strong> <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/2014-rsl-roster-2014-02-241.png" alt="2014 RSL Roster - 2014-02-24"> <strong>**Nick Rimando returns to man the <span class="caps">RSL</span> nets for the 8<span class="ord">th</span> consecutive season. There’s nothing much that can be said about Rimando that you probably don’t already know. A 14-year veteran of the league, Rimando has ascended to third in command of the United States net. Remarkably, Rimando has a 10-0-0 record with the U.S. team, and is already tied for 5<span class="ord">th</span> all-time on the goalkeeper victory list with Brad Guzan. Rimando’s national team opportunities have come as a result of stellar club play. Last season, he finished 2<span class="ord">nd</span> to Donovan Ricketts in Goalkeeper of the Year award voting, and was probably unlucky to do so. Rimando really is the total package: His </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYpEGAKFud0">reflexes and shot-stopping ability</a><strong> are legendary, and while it may not surprise you that Rimando finished 4<span class="ord">th</span> in pass completion percentage, the diminutive Rimando is also an excellent commander of his penalty area. In 2014, Rimando finished 4<span class="ord">th</span> in <span class="caps">MLS</span> in catches per 90 with 2.63. This paragraph is far too long for one that could have been summed up simply with “Real Salt Lake is in good hands with Nick Rimando.” </strong>Continuity in the Back<strong> With Chris Wingert, Nat Borchers, Chris Schuler, and Tony Beltran patrolling in front of him, Nick Rimando, too, will be in good hands. In the playoffs, Borchers and Schuler showed the potential to become one of the best pairings in the league. Though that is contingent on whether Schuler can remain healthy. In both the 2012 and 2013 seasons, Schuler was sidelined for multiple months with a foot injury. It was evident just how much Salt Lake missed Schuler last season when he was injured: with Schuler on the field last season, <span class="caps">RSL</span> conceded only 0.94 goals per 90, without him, they conceded 1.45 goals per 90. Yes, the sample size is small, and no, these numbers do not take into account opponent and location of the game. Still, Schuler’s contributions to defense were evident when 20-year old Carlos Salcedo was forced to step in. Nat Borchers provides much more certainty. In his 9-year Major League Soccer career (he spent two years with Odd Grenland in Norway), Borchers has averaged more than 28 starts per season. </strong><img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/rslinfo.png?w=182" alt="RSLinfo">The Best Defense…** However, for all they do defensively, it may be their contributions to the attack that makes the <span class="caps">RSL</span> backline so valuable. Nat Borchers is one of the calmest defensive distributers in the league. Last season he had the 3<span class="ord">rd</span> best pass completion rate in the league, behind only Osvaldo Alonso and George John. This may be because Real Salt Lake puts a premium on possession and building the attack from the back, which sees Beckerman and the rest of the midfielders providing outlet options constantly. The team led MLS last season in possession percentage, pass success percentage, and percentage of passes that were under 25 yards. After all, Kwame Watson-Siriboe finished with a 93% passing rate (in but a mere handful of games), and Carlos Salcedo and Schuler both finished above&nbsp;80%.</p>
