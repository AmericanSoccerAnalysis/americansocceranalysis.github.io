          <section class="content"><p>Most people would associate Chivas <span class="caps">USA</span> with the pinnacle of terribleness within MLS. They’ve accrued all of 56 points combined the last two seasons which barely eclipses the LA Galaxy totals, their evil timeshare neighbor, over the course of just one year. The club from the beginning has sported a feel that was awkward—-almost insulting—-and it has been a bit of an outcast from the rest of the league. Despite what we all know about them now, it’s easy to forget that as few as five years ago they were the more dominant LA brand, earning top-three finishes in 2006, 2007 and in 2008. They were lead by the likes of US internationals <strong>Brad Guzan</strong>, <strong>Sacha Kljestan</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Bornstein</strong>. They boasted the scoring prowess of <strong>Ante Razov</strong>, one of the premier scoring talents in <span class="caps">MLS</span> history, who is still the club’s all-time goal scorer. Despite the recent woes, it’s not outside the realm of possibility that they could return to a run of strong form. But it will likely need to be built upon the youth and Academy products they’ve been working to develop, as Chivas USA has been cited as one of the more talent rich organizations at the youth level. Make no mistake about it; things are just starting to get interesting in the City of Angels. <strong>2013 Finish: 26 points, 9<span class="ord">th</span> in the Western Conference, Missed Playoffs</strong> <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/chivasxi.png" alt="ChivasXI"></p>
