          <section class="content"><p>Three things in this&nbsp;post:</p>
<p>1. <span class="caps">MLS</span> final 2. Goalkeeper of the Year Award 3. MLS Goalkeeper Final&nbsp;Destination</p>
<p><strong>1. <span class="caps">MLS</span> final </strong> [youtube=<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SJq24zFwoQ&amp;w=560&amp;h=315">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SJq24zFwoQ&amp;w=560&amp;h=315</a>] We were all made aware of the conditions before the game. The ice on the field, the cold temperatures, the effects on the ball… but then again, it’s the final in your sport so maybe it’s not the best time to come up with&nbsp;excuses.</p>
<p>The final featured <a href="/articles/mls-cup-thoughts-and-general-goal-keeper-roundup/www.pamplinmedia.com/pt/12-sports/203265-mls-awards-go-to-ricketts-valeri-">two of the three finalists</a> for Goalkeeper of the Year so we should expect an exciting display between both set of posts. This was not the case. Let’s walk through the&nbsp;video </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>0:58</strong> - Nick Rimando makes a half-falling/half-diving save in the twenty-fifth minute. It’s enough in his mitts that he can hold it, but he pushes it wide and almost bonks his&nbsp;head.</li>
<li><strong>1:28</strong> - Nielsen gets a little too far under a punch and sends it straight up in the air, almost setting up a gift of a&nbsp;goal.</li>
<li><strong>2:20</strong> - If you notice, this is the third highlight and we’re almost through the first half. That might tell you something. Rimando stays alert, and the bouncing ball isn’t in complete control of Dwyer. It’s a needed save but not that tough. Rimando has time to get there and Dwyer has a limited shooting angle on&nbsp;goal.</li>
<li><strong>2:40</strong> - Start of the second half sees <span class="caps">CJ</span> Sapong with the ball in front of goal yet again. Rimando gets caught going the wrong way when Sapong cuts off the cross. He tries to scramble to the post but luckily (for Rimando) the shot skies&nbsp;over.</li>
<li><p><strong>3:25</strong> - <span class="caps">RSL</span> gets the first goal of the game from a nice no-look-pass from Beckerman to Sabario who chests then volleys it home. But check out Nielsen’s starting position on the shot. <img src="http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-12-30-50-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 12.30.50 PM"> So far from the line! He could have chipped him if he tried (foreshadowing, wooOOoo!). Sabario takes the trap and Nielsen (who starts calling for a handball) is so far from the line he can’t get into position well enough (notice the green triangles below). If he’s closer to the line he can get into position better and he’ll have more time to react, likely making the save.

</li>
<li><p><strong>4:50</strong> - Beckerman takes a shot from distance. On the replay (5:12), check out Nielsen’s left foot: cemented into the ground. His right foot does all the moving. This is not good. Just turning your body to make a save really limits the distance you can cover. A quicker shuffle to Nielsen’s left can get a hand on that&nbsp;shot.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>5:25</strong> - Possibly the biggest “<span class="caps">LOL</span>” of the match. Nielsen is so far off his line that the most casual chip almost beats him. The ball doesn’t even clear the crossbar, if that tells you how non-chalant the chip was. <img src="http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-12-59-41-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 12.59.41 PM"> Nielsen turns around, surprised the ball is still in play, chases it out and eats snow hard.&nbsp;Woof.</li>
<li><strong>6:40</strong> - <span class="caps">SKC</span> equalizes with a questionably fair header…Rimando bounces over but can’t make the extension. [caption id=”attachment<em>912” align=”aligncenter” width=”490”]<img src="http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-1-03-38-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 1.03.38 PM"> _If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.</em>[/caption]</li>
<li><strong>7:20</strong> - Ninety-third minute and Rimando makes the “Allstate Good Hands Save of the Match”. A simple tip over from a blast eight yards&nbsp;out.</li>
<li><strong>7:50</strong> - Sapong with another chance while being&nbsp;mauled.</li>
<li><strong>8:25</strong> - I’ll just leave this picture to sum up the events here:<img src="http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-2-44-10-am.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 2.44.10 AM"></li>
<li>Apparently nothing happened for the next fifteen minutes and the penalties ensue. Here are the tendancies for Nielsen and Rimando:<img src="http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-1-19-58-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 1.19.58 PM"> The “n’s” and “y’s” are if the keepers guessed the correct way or not. A “y” means yes he did, obviously, and the asterisks mean that while he guessed correctly the ball missed the goal frame. The green represents all the times the shooter did not score (after five rounds it was 3-3, three reds each). Both goalkeepers guessed the right way four of the ten times. The last two columns are where the keepers were guessing. Rimando was 5-2-3 (left-middle-right) and Nielsen was 6-0-4. So if you needed any more proof that shootouts are more determined by the shooters than goalkeeper then… well I don’t know. This games looks pretty clear to me. Nielsen is painted as the shootout hero but almost has the exact same stats as Rimando, not to mention all his follies from the run of play. Also he’s about five feet off his line on the eighth-round shot. (I know the ball is well-past kicked at this point, but he was in the process of planting his foot so it was blurry. Also balls kicked travel faster than feet move.)<img src="http://everybodysoccer.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2013-12-08-at-2-34-30-am.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-12-08 at 2.34.30 AM">
At least it was a fun game. We can all agree on&nbsp;that. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Goalkeeper of the Year&nbsp;Award</strong></p>
<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
<p><strong><a href="/articles/mls-cup-thoughts-and-general-goal-keeper-roundup/#174" title="2013-12-09 14:03:31">Matthias Kullowatz</a>:</strong> Those angles on the Saborio shot are telling. Nielsen could have gotten another foot or two closer to the near post! “…current goalkeeping stats are too simple and don’t gauge anything of real value.”&nbsp;Amen.</p>
