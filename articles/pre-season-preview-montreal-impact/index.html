          <section class="content"><p>The newest franchise in Major League Soccer, the Montreal Impact, has carved out its niche pretty distinctly since inception in 2012. With strong ties to Serie A through multiple Italian players, Montreal has seen decent success for such a new franchise. They just missed the playoffs in their expansion year, and sneaked in as the five seed last year. But with the success has come another reputation: they already seem rather fond of changing coaches. Entering their third season of play, Montreal’s owner Joey Saputo is already onto his third manager, with Frank Klopas taking the wheel in 2014. <strong>2013 Finish: 49 Points, 5<span class="ord">th</span> in Eastern Conference, Qualified for <span class="caps">MLS</span> Cup playoff, lost in conference play-in round.</strong> <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/montrealxi.png" alt="MontrealXI"></p>

<strong>Roster Churn:</strong> 82.98% returning minutes (4<span class="ord">th</span> highest in <span class="caps">MLS</span>) <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/roster-montreal.png" alt="roster-Montreal">2013 started out about as perfect as any Impact fan could have hoped. But the team then coughed, sputtered, and wheezed its way into the wildcard round of the postseason, where th<img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/mtlinfo3.png?w=182" alt="MTLINFO">e coughing and wheezing turned to seizing, and Montreal’s campaign met an early demise. Marco Schallibaum’s tenure started with a bang, as Montreal won each of its first four games by one tally each, all of them by a scoreline of 1-0 or 2-1. Those close, low-scoring victories figured to set the tone for the season—-Montreal was a stout defensive team who would get bodies behind the ball and look to finish swift counter-attacks through <strong>Marco Di Vaio</strong>. This formula helped them to win the Canadian Championship for a second year running, qualifying them for next season’s <span class="caps">CONCACAF</span> Champions League. Unfortunately, their tactical secret wasn’t particularly well-kept throughout the league, as opposing teams figured out how to counter the Impact’s strategy after about the first third of the season. The regular season’s final 20 games saw only five Montreal victories, as they earned just a point per game during that span while simultaneously crashing out of last year’s CCL. Still, their hot start was enough to squeeze into the Eastern Conference knockout round, as they slipped into the five seed thanks to a superior goal difference to Chicago. But the luck would run out for Schallibaum and the French-Canadian club in a hurry, as they were beaten and outclassed by the Houston Dynamo in the do-or-die playoff, 3-0. The game was as damaging to Montreal’s reputation, too, as <strong>Nelson Rivas</strong>, <strong>Andres Romero</strong> and Di Vaio were all ejected for various infractions. The last moments of the match devolved into more of a cat-fight than a soccer match, with the men in blue performing the side of jealous aggressors. In the end, not only was the season over but so too was Schallibaum’s tenure in Montreal; he was fired a few weeks later. I’ll be frank: it’s hard to imagine that this year’s Montreal Impact is much improved over last year’s iteration. And with seemingly every other team in the Eastern Conference signing big name Designated Players, it would follow that Montreal’s stagnation would see them drop a few rungs in the standings this season. Don’t take my word for it – just ask central defender <strong>Matteo Ferrari</strong>. Here’s a clue for the future expansion sides in <span class="caps">MLS</span>: it’s never a good sign when your club has to release a statement clarifying that one of your top players is in fact on the same page as your technical&nbsp;director.</p>
