          <section class="content"><p>Over the past three seasons, fans of the Hoops have seen their team crash down from the high of a 2010 <span class="caps">MLS</span> Cup Finals appearance . In 2012, those same fans endured a 13-game winless streak, to be followed by another 11-game winless streak in 2013, resulting in Dallas missing the playoffs each of the past two seasons. What made matters worse was their red hot start to 2013, where they raced out to a 7-2-3 record and 24 points by the end of May, good for first place in the West. After missing out on the post season following such a hot start, Schellas Hyndman was shown the door (officially resigned), and former FC Dallas player and long time assistant Oscar Pareja was hired to right the ship. There is much optimism surrounding Dallas as they look to put the past behind them and get themselves back into the playoffs in&nbsp;2014.</p>

<p><img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/roster-dallas.png" alt="roster-dallas">Lots of optimism surround the Hoops after the theft appointment of <strong>Oscar</strong> “Papi” <strong>Pareja</strong> as head coach, and for good reason. The former Colorado Rapids head coach was highly regarded by the front office, was a contender for <span class="caps">MLS</span> <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/dalinfo1.png?w=182" alt="DALINFO">Coach of the Year after Colorado overachieved last season with their young roster, thanks in some part to Pareja’s&nbsp;guidance.</p>
<p>While the optimism is high, there are also some concerns with the team, as they jettisoned off a few key pieces from last year (Captain <strong>David Ferreira</strong>, striker <strong>Kenny Cooper</strong>, and winger <strong>Jackson</strong>), and now <span class="caps">FC</span> Dallas must work through that awkward transition where new faces and a new coach try to get on the same page. Will the front office and Dallas fans be patient enough to wait for Pareja to work his magic, given they’ve missed the playoffs two season in a row now? His first season in Colorado was forgettable (11-19-4, no playoffs), but there were clear signs of improvement in his second year (14-11-9, knock out&nbsp;rounds).</p>
