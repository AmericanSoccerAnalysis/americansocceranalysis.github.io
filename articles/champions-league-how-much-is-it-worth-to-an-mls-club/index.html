          <section class="content"><p>The major talking point concerning the <span class="caps">CONCACAF</span> Champions League, and gaining entry into the tournament, is the payroll increase that MLS affords a club that qualifies. Now, this isn’t the sizable increase for a club that we see for a team in Europe, but it has the potential to be a game-changer in MLS, depending on the team and its ownership. Most figures concerning team salary/payroll are generally guarded for obvious reasons. However, rather than using official numbers, I went through the data generously provided by the <a href="http://www.mlsplayers.org/salary_info.html">Players Union</a> and calculated the accrued difference in pay between when the team won entry and the following year after the increase. Now, as it happens, the Union only has data posted as far back as 2007, that’s okay. Since the tournament underwent changes, adapting to it’s current format back in 2008. [caption id=”attachment_730” align=”aligncenter” width=”401”]<img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/championsleagueincrease.png" alt="ChampionsLeagueIncrease"> Figures above in millions of American dollars.[/caption] Obviously, this is still a small sample size, but it gives you a rough figure on how this could help <span class="caps">DC</span> United and the other Champion-League-bound clubs this season.  A big caveat to using the Unions’ data is that its just a snap shot at a given point in the season. Not necessarily what they paid out in dues for the entire campaign. An obvious tip-off to that is Seattle dropping payroll from 2009 to 2010. They didn’t cut funds, but because late in the season they traded away Freddie Ljungberg to Chicago, his cost was associated with their club despite Seattle playing the majority of his contract for the season. This is just one example among 20 unique situations. No season is the same. The LA Galaxy and their 16% cut in 2011 largely came from David Beckham’s greatly reduced fee. 2013 comes and that fee is entirely off the book with his trip to PSG and the Galaxy not replacing his huge contract with another high paid designated player. Instead they signed Omar Gonzalez. Still a team gaining access to the Champions League enjoys a nice 9% raise in their annual spending, and as is the case in other leagues, dollars spent correlate to points and position in the table to some&nbsp;degree.</p>
