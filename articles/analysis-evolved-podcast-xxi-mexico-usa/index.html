          <section class="content"><p>This was suppose to be a quick 15-to-20-minute podcast that turned into an almost 52-minute single segment ramble about all things <span class="caps">US</span> in the past week. It was just Drew and I, covering just about everything conceivable over the course of the loss to Costa Rica on the road to the win in Columbus against Mexico. No spoilers; just have a listen. [audio <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/asa-episode-xxi.mp3">http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/asa-episode-xxi.mp3</a>] <em>*Editors note:</em> <em>Matthias to Drew by text after <span class="caps">CR</span>’s second goal: [Howard didn’t look ready for that one. I think he could have done more.]</em> <em>Matthias to Drew by text after <span class="caps">CR</span>’s third goal: [The defender definitely got beat, but the Costa Rican player didn’t even get to the ball until it was 23 yards out. That’s Howard’s ball. </em> <em>Drew on Podcast: “…and Matthias was texting me…Matthias was like ‘what’s he doing in there? These goals are all his fault.’ “</em> <em>In a private interview with the Matthias, the editor was assured that Matthias never thought the goals were 100% Howard’s fault, as Matthias—-a student of probability—-rarely believes anything is 100%.</em> <em>Oh, and Drew is a poophead. </em>   <em>**Editors note part 2:</em> <em>Matthias edited is the editor of the site, just in case you didn’t realize&nbsp;that.</em></p>
