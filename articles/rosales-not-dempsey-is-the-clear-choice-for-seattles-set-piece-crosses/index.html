          <section class="content"><p>In Seattle’s 2-1 loss to Portland on Saturday, Clint Dempsey took all of the Sounders’ attacking set-pieces in the first half. He was impressive with his free kick shots on goal, clipping the crossbar and forcing Donovan Ricketts into multiple saves. But his corner kicks left much to be desired. Mauro Rosales subbed on in the 63<span class="ord">rd</span> minute and took the remainder of the set-piece crosses and created more chances. With Lamar Neagle suspended for yellow card accumulation and Seattle needing goals in leg two, Rosales seems likely to start. Requisite warning about small sample sizes aside, based off of the results in leg one, the data suggest Sigi Schmidt would be wise to let Rosales take over set-piece crossing duties in the second leg. Here’s how Dempsey’s nine corners and one free kick cross went in leg one: <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/dempseyleg1fks.jpg?w=300" alt="DempseyLeg1FKs"> 3<span class="ord">rd</span> minute corner: To the near post, cleared by Diego Chara 6<span class="ord">th</span> corner: Near post, cleared by Will Johnson 20<span class="ord">th</span> corner: Near post, cleared by Will Johnson 25<span class="ord">th</span> corner: Near post, cleared by Chara 32<span class="ord">nd</span> corner: Near post, cleared by Chara 38<span class="ord">th</span> corner: Top of the six yard box, cleared by Pa-Moudou Kah 38<span class="ord">th</span> corner: Top of six, cleared by Kah 39<span class="ord">th</span> free kick: Cross from 18 yards out on the wing to the top of the six, cleared by Futty Danso 45<span class="ord">th</span> corner: Near post, punched clear by Ricketts In the second half, Rosales took all three Seattle corners and two free kick crosses: <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/rosalesleg1fks.jpg?w=300" alt="RosalesLeg1FKs"> 68<span class="ord">th</span> minute corner: To the penalty spot, shot by Djimi Traore, saved by Ricketts 69<span class="ord">th</span> corner: Top of six, Headed cross by Dempsey  blocked by Zemanski and eventually caught by Ricketts 82<span class="ord">nd</span> free kick: Cross from 38 yards in the center to the penalty spot, cleared by Danso 86<span class="ord">th</span> free kick: Cross from 28 yards on the wing to the edge of the penalty box, headed by Shalrie Joseph across the box 87<span class="ord">th</span> corner: Penalty spot, Headed shot by Dempsey off of the crossbar and out In summary: Dempsey had 10 set-piece crosses, none of which reached a Seattle teammate. Rosales had five set-piece crosses, four of which found a teammate in the box, and three of which led to shots. As you can tell, it was a tale of two halves. In the first, Dempsey’s crosses rarely cleared the first defender, and none found another Sounders player. In the second half, four of Rosales’ five crosses created chances, two off of the head of Dempsey himself. If Seattle is going to win at Jeld-Wen Field on Thursday, they’ll need to do better with their crosses. Based on their chances in game one, it looks to be in the Sounders’ best interest to allow Rosales to take the free kick crosses in game two. Not only did his crosses create better chances than Dempsey in game one, but Deuce seems to be more dangerous getting on the end of crosses than he is at taking&nbsp;them.</p>
