          <section class="content"><p>A franchise empathetic to the Buffalo Bills, Atlanta Braves, and every team that chased the Chicago Bulls in the 90’s, the Revs have shown over their 16-year history in the league that they are perpetual contenders and forever runners-up—-a key member of the ‘almost was there’ club. That was harsh, but I don’t mean to be. The club, with just a little bit of support from Robert Kraft, could have been—-and still could be—-a super power in <span class="caps">MLS</span>. The trio of Clint Dempsey, Shalrie Joseph, and Steve Ralston, and then the often forgotten (outside of New England) prowess of Taylor Twellman dominated the mid 00’s period of MLS, and New England reached the MLS Cup finals on four different occasions between 2002 and 2007. Now, after a couple of down years, the franchise has reloaded and found itself a new era of young up-and-comers a decade later. <strong>2013 Review: 51 Points, 3<span class="ord">rd</span> in the Eastern Conference, lost to Sporting Kansas City in Conference Semis</strong> <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/newenglandxi.png" alt="newenglandXI"></p>

2013 opened for the Revs with expectations of justhoping to make the Wildcard round. Really, anything better than finishing above Toronto was the end goal, and while maybe I’m slightly exaggerating the situation a bit, I don’t think many thought they would finish 3<span class="ord">rd</span> in the East. <strong>Jay Heaps</strong> definitely sat upon a seat of growing embers, and fans were gradually getting more and more anxious to see progression from their second-year manager after replacing long-term icon <strong>Steve Nicol</strong>.</p>
