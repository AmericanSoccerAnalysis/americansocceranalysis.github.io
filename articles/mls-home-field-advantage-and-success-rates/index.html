          <section class="content"><p>This week on <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.wordpress.com/2013/07/28/asa-podcast-episode-15-the-one-where-we-talk-about-home-field-advantage/">the podcast</a> we talked a bit about home field advantage and the fact that it undeniably exists. But while it does exist, the question then becomes to what extent does it exist? What teams have taken advantage of it over the past few years? I went back as far as 2008 to collect some data. I’m not sure what this data all means, but I feel that it, at the very least, gives us a bit of commentary on those teams that had success and failure on their home pitches. I broke clubs into two groups: teams that scored more than 40 points and teams that scored less than 40 points. Then I compiled some key home stats for the two groups. A quick key for the stats used: <strong>%home won</strong>, is the percentage of possible games at home at the team won. Duh, right? <strong>%home points</strong> is the percentage of its home games in which the team nabbed <em>any</em> points (draw or win). <strong>%total of points</strong> is how many points from home games contributed to their total points accrued over the season. Then <strong><span class="caps">GD</span></strong> is just goal&nbsp;differential. </p>

<p><strong><a href="/articles/mls-home-field-advantage-and-success-rates/#53" title="2013-08-02 10:36:31">Matthias Kullowatz</a>:</strong> It’s interesting that both the top-finishing teams and bottom-finishing teams are able to avoid losses at home equally, but it’s the wins and draws that separate them. I wonder how much of that is that good teams are able to earn those three points, and how much of that is random. Kind of like the Baltimore Orioles last season winning all those one-run and extra-innings games, when most telling baseball statistics said they were probably a mediocre team. Just because you have a good record doesn’t mean you were a good team! I want shot ratios, Harrison!&nbsp;;-)</p>
