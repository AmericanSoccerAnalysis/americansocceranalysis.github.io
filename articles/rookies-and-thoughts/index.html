<p><strong><span class="caps">CARLOS</span> ALVAREZ, MIDFIELDER - CHIVAS&nbsp;USA</strong></p>
<p>Alvarez does a lot of things really well. He’s rotated through a few different positions in the midfield for El Chelis this season and his accumulated stats kind of reflect&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Though interesting enough, for as up-and-down as the attack is, Alvarez hasn’t touched the ball as much as you think. At only 8.62% of his teams touches, he hasn’t been as involved in the total care of the&nbsp;ball.</p>
