          <section class="content"><p><em>Please welcome to our little team of analysists and helpers Chris Gluck, whose <span class="caps">PWP</span> is going to be added to the metrics table this year—-a solid instrument in telling us how teams have performed in turning possession into goals. Currently it’s one of the best _open-source _metrics out there to tell us such things. I hope you’ll enjoy his contributions as much I will - Harrison</em> <strong>First things first —- my thanks to Harrison Crow and Matthias Kullowatz for the opportunity to post my Possession with Purpose Introduction on American Soccer Analysis.</strong> If you’ve been following me this past year through <a href="http://blogs.columbian.com/portland-timbers/">Columbian Newspaper</a>&#8211;out of southern Washington—you’ll know that I’ve been researching statistics in Major League Soccer. My intent has been to develop a simplified (Strategic) set of team performance indicators that may help others better understand soccer and how the outcome of a game may be better understood based on the primary inputs to the game.  Data for my research comes from documenting and analyzing all 646 <span class="caps">MLS</span> Regular Season games in 2013; the source data originates with OPTA and is displayed on the MLS Chalkboard and the MLS Statistics Sheet found through <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/">www.mlssoccer.com</a>. <strong>With that here’s my introduction on Possession with Purpose… </strong> To first understand the context, I offer that this is one of the End States of my effort: <em>create a simplified approach and documented method for measuring team performance where the output is an Index that (while excluding points) comes close to matching results in the <span class="caps">MLS</span> League Table</em>. Beginning with that End State in mind here is the End State product: <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/pic1.jpg?w=890" alt="pic1"> <strong>Observations from the Diagram…</strong> Note that 9 of the top 10 teams in this Index made the <span class="caps">MLS</span> Playoffs last year with the Houston Dynamo finishing 12<span class="ord">th</span> in the Index.  For comparison, in benchmarking whoscored.com their Index only had 8 of their top 10 teams make the Playoffs, while www.squawka .com matched my 90% success rating, but the team they missed in the top 10 (New England) finished 16<span class="ord">th</span> in their Index. From a strategic standpoint, the End State objective has been met; <em>create a simplified approach and documented method for measuring team performance where the output is an Index that (while excluding points) comes close to matching results in the <span class="caps">MLS</span> League Table</em>.  <strong>Defining the <span class="caps">PWP</span> Attacking and Defending Processes…</strong> Here are the six steps in the <span class="caps">PWP</span> Strategic Attacking&nbsp;Process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gain possession of the&nbsp;ball,</li>
<li>Retain possession and move the&nbsp;ball,</li>
<li>Penetrate <span class="amp">&amp;</span> create goal scoring&nbsp;opportunities,</li>
<li>Take shots when provided goal scoring&nbsp;opportunities,</li>
<li>Put those shots taken on&nbsp;goal,</li>
<li><p>Score the goal.
Here are the six steps in the <span class="caps">PWP</span> Strategic Defending&nbsp;Process:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Minimize opponent gaining possession of the&nbsp;ball,</p>
</li>
<li>Minimize opponent retaining possession and moving the&nbsp;ball,</li>
<li>Minimize opponent penetrating and creating goal scoring&nbsp;opportunities,</li>
<li>Minimize opponent taking shots when provided goal scoring&nbsp;opportunities,</li>
<li>Minimize opponent putting those shots on&nbsp;goal,</li>
<li>Minimize opponent scoring the goal.
Every step is this process has an average success rate (percentage) based upon data gathered from all 646 <span class="caps">MLS</span> Regular Season games. <strong>Understanding the context of these steps versus other conditions and activities that influence the outcome of a game…</strong> In case you missed it I call these Processes and the Indices “Strategic” to separate their value/meaning relative to other things that can influence the outcome of a game. For me I have two other ways to classify information that can influence the outcomes in those steps. I have Operational conditions and Tactical metrics; provided below are some examples of&nbsp;each:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>Operational conditions</em>: Scheme of maneuver a team uses in setting up their system, such as flat-back four, flat-back three, double-pivot midfield, single-pivot midfield, bunkering with counterattacking, pressing high, direct attacking, possession-oriented attacking, weather conditions, location of the game (home/away), conference foe, non-conference foe,&nbsp;etc…</li>
<li><p><em>Tactical metrics</em>: Locations of shots taken, shots on goal, and goals scored; penalty kicks, free kicks, crosses, headers won/lost, tackles won/lost, interceptions, clearances, blocked crosses, blocked shots, etc. 
The diagram below shows the <span class="caps">PWP</span> Strategic Attacking Process with the average percentage of success rate in MLS for 2013. A more detailed explanation of each step is provided below the diagram. <img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/pic2.jpg?w=890" alt="pic2"> <strong>Step 1: Gain possession of the ball:</strong> The intent behind this basic step should be clear; you can’t win the game if you don’t possess the ball to some extent. A second consideration about this step is that the more you possess the ball the less your opponent possesses the&nbsp;ball.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From a defensive standpoint there are any number of ways a team can work to gain possession of the ball; they include, but are not limited to, tackling, intercepting, clearing the ball, winning fifty-fifty duels on the ground or in the air, or simply gathering a loose ball based upon a deflection or bad&nbsp;pass.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="/articles/possession-with-purpose-an-introduction-and-some-explanations/#235" title="2014-02-27 15:19:05">Phil Luetchford</a>:</strong> Would “failed assists” be the same as Opta’s “key passes,” thereby making “chances created” the metric you are looking for in Step 4? That still wouldn’t cover times where the shot never went off, like in your example. Your formula of Shots Taken/Completed Passes in the Attacking Third is a measure of how direct that team is playing. I expected to see Chances Created somewhere in Step 3 or 4 and am wondering how you managed to avoid&nbsp;that.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/articles/possession-with-purpose-an-introduction-and-some-explanations/#204" title="2014-01-17 10:24:57">chrisgluck</a>:</strong> Thanks for your comments and great to hear you enjoyed it as much as you did. :) Your thoughts on location are important to consider - there are many folks out there that already do great work on analyzing shot locations and I think you may see some pretty cool stuff on this site in the next few months as well. For me, and this effort, Shot locations falls under Tactical Metrics so the location itself won’t appear as Strategic measurement. As the <span class="caps">PWP</span> effort is expanded the shot location will become a feeder into the larger success rate percentages. Not sure how well that reads but think of it as an onion - the whole onion are the 6 steps and within each of those steps there are layers that influence the outcome - sometimes tactical metrics like ‘tackles’ will influence more than one step - shot locations should influence the final three steps so they will be reviewed over time to see their influence in those six steps. I hope that helps? You are also correct about the score-line influencing activities on the pitch - for me, the score-line change is an Operational condition of the game when it occurs. In earlier work on PWP I noted that as the scoreline changed a number of activities were influenced and if down 1-nil; 2-nil with 10-15 minutes to go a team that is possession-oriented is likely to apply more direct attacking… this condition will slightly skew the data so it’s important to know when that happens. As I’m only one guy I don’t have the time to get into that level of detail yet :). Another great challenge for many of us stats guys is that the open-source data folks make it very hard for us to separate out simple stats given a score-line change; perhaps that will change in the near future? All the best and keep up your research!&nbsp;Chris</p>
<p><strong><a href="/articles/possession-with-purpose-an-introduction-and-some-explanations/#203" title="2014-01-17 00:06:17">jaredeyoung</a>:</strong> I’m so impressed I want to cry. This is really incredible. I’ve been thinking of a similar “process” for the work I want to do but this blows it away. I will probably continue to work on my more simplified approach but know that I am defeated :) I am surprised you don’t factor in the location of the shot as an important factor in creating value. More passes in the final third should lead to a better shot and therefore more goals. Also, if you look at the score of the game when the shot was taken you can get a proxy for defensive pressure being applied in the final 3<span class="ord">rd</span>. There’s a great post on 11tegen11.net that works through that. Could be something to add in the future. But this is&nbsp;awesome.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/articles/possession-with-purpose-an-introduction-and-some-explanations/#206" title="2014-01-19 02:00:30">Harrison Crow</a>:</strong> As Chris allueded to, <span class="caps">ASA</span> will be presenting a lot of really exciting and detailed information with shot locations and game states that will only further influence this type of work by people like&nbsp;Chris.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/articles/possession-with-purpose-an-introduction-and-some-explanations/#236" title="2014-02-27 16:25:25">chrisgluck</a>:</strong> Phil, Great question(s) and this may take a few minutes to answer - “failed assists” includes more than just Opta Key Passes - at least the key passes that have been offered up and defined in the <span class="caps">MLS</span> Chalkboard. I also believe Opta makes a judgment call ‘after’ a pass is made to determine whether or not it was ‘key’; I disagree with this judgmental decision - any pass into the box is ‘key’ - what makes it more or less key is how well the defenders versus attackers manage that pass… does that make sense? In a regular football environment, for me as a coach, any cross offered up into the 18 yard box is an opportunity for a teammate to take it and score from it - in counting key passes in Opta they are also not included in that definition of a key pass. And interestingly enough crosses that are successful are not even counted as ‘successful passes’ in Opta either. But as noted in the article unsucessful crosses are counted as ‘unsuccessful passes’. So without having detailed information on the ‘stream of passes working towards a shot taken’ the only strategic recourse is to look for a general relationship between passes made (successful and unsuccessful as appropriate) to shots taken. At least that way the approach is consistent for all the teams in MLS. ‘Chances created’ is not quite the same as ‘goal scoring opportunities created’; for me a ‘chance created’ is where the teammate has latched onto the ball and taken a shot - I am looking at more than just that - I also want to be able to glean how effective the defense was in preventing that GSO from becoming a ‘chance created’ - for me a ‘chance created’ would be derived from minusing out ‘defensive activities like defensive clearances. So in essence I didn’t manage to avoid that I simply can’t collect it at this time given the data that is available. But also note that my calculation includes ‘successful passes’ so by using that I am separating out defensive activities that result in an unsuccessful pass. If you read some of my earlier articles on possession with purpose, on my blog site, the first 15 - 20 games or so I did specifically collect that data for Portland - and there is clear evidence that possession, penetration, creation of goal scoring opportunities (as I’d like to define them), defensive clearances, shots taken, shots on goal and goals scored had a very strong inter-relationship with each other - my R2 for that curvelinear relationship was .987. The R2 at that time for the simple ‘goals scored’ hovered around .6000 or so - clearly reinforcing that the ‘collective analysis of multiple data points in a stream of possession’ outweigh the value of just one data point (goals scored). But that data was hand collected for every Timbers match and is not/was not available across all MLS teams - so I had to adjust to establish an equal playing field to analyze in order to create the Indices I had intended on creating. Hence the decision to work with shots taken versus completed passes. I do suggest that this adjusted approach is not perfect :) as I statistically already know this given my previous (single focused) analysis on the Timbers. So in answer to your last consideration is chances created somewhere in step 3 or 4, yes - with my individual research on Portland last year step 3 is ‘physical penetrations’ (counts) and step 4 is ‘goal scoring opportunities created’ (counts) (inbetween there are the defensive activities/clearances that occur prior to the shot being taken). I also tracked what side (left right or middle) where the penetration occured and then (left right or middle) where the GSO occured and what type of GSO was used - cross, free kick, corner, throughball, switch, long ball from square 1, etc) That being said, and the lack of global data for all MLS teams using that criteria, I had to adjust in considering the overall output (the Index generated). Even in adjusting there remains a statistical relationship that can and does have relevance to an End State in comparison to the final league tables. 90% accuracy is on the same par as having an R2 of .9000. I would offer that if statistical analyses are to be leveraged to better understand teams then the statistical data collected and offered freely to the public needs to get better. Others besides myself, Ted Knutson, have noted that the Opta data could be a whole lot better… so I didn’t manage to avoid that approach - I simply couldn’t execute that approach outside of just analyzing the Timbers… I hope that answers your question and it may provide more than you want to know :) Feel free to contact me anytime Phil - always love chatting about trying to get better, more relevant data, from&nbsp;Opta…</p>
<p><strong><a href="/articles/possession-with-purpose-an-introduction-and-some-explanations/#237" title="2014-02-27 17:46:50">chrisgluck</a>:</strong> Phil, One other important consideration here is that ‘chances created’ and then ‘shots taken’ is geared more to a ‘tactical success’ rate of a particular player as opposed to the strategic team performance index that <span class="caps">GSO</span>’s look at - for example - there are superb stats out there on whose taking shots, putting them on target and then scoring - what is missing is the ‘team’ creation of those opportunities that can come from anywhere by anyone - even the goal keeper on a long ball (assist or failed assist) - to support that ball striker on a collective basis. Put another way - within this strategic approach there are ‘operational considerations’ that influence the game and then ‘tactical details’ that influence the game - how well an individual striker executes that tactical step falls up under the difference between GSOs created and those that are stopped by team defense (clearances, interceptions etc) as well as the individual ability of the striker… guess what I am trying to say is consider the phrase ‘chances created’ falls up under ‘tactical metrics’ that support or can be influenced by operational metrics that tuck up under ‘strategic indicators’ - does that help&nbsp;clarify?</p>
