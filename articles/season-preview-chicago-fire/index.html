          <section class="content"><p>The Chicago Fire won <span class="caps">MLS</span> Cup in their first season in the league. They qualified for the playoffs in 12 of their first 13 seasons in MLS. But since 2010, they’ve made the postseason only once (in 2012), where they lost in the first round. For such a storied franchise, it’s clear that Chicago has underachieved for the last four years. Hopes in the Windy City are that a new coach with a history of success in MLS, Frank Yallop, will be able to turn around their fortunes and return the club to the promised land. <strong><strong>2013 Finish: 49 Points, 6<span class="ord">th</span> in the Western Conference, Missed <span class="caps">MLS</span> Playoffs</strong></strong> <strong><img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/chicagoxi.png" alt="ChicagoXI"></strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong> [caption id=”attachment_1579” align=”alignleft” width=”169”]<img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/chicago-fires-2014-roster.png" alt="Median Age: 25"> Median Age: 25<br><em>Designated Player[/caption] Their 2013 was really bad followed by pretty good, but ending in disappointment. The Fire began the season looking more like kindling (sorry, that’s the only fire-related pun I’ll use in this post), losing seven of their first ten matches. But then they started making moves, both in the front office and up the table. Chicago acquired centerback <strong>Bakary Soumare</strong> from Philadelphia and forward <strong>Mike Magee</strong> from Los Angeles, and their ascent quickly followed. Soumare brought a much-needed solidity to the back line, and Magee played out of his mind for the remainder of the season in his hometown. After running off six matches unbeaten immediately following their acquisition, the Fire came back to Earth and narrowly missed out on the East’s final playoff spot, bowing to Montreal on a tiebreaker. The season was not without its hardware though, as Magee won the league <span class="caps">MVP</span> trophy, despite being traded<img src="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/chiinfo1.png?w=182" alt="CHIINFO"> <a href="http://americansocceranalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/chiinfo1.png"> </a>On paper, the Chicago Fire seem like they have the pieces to be a contender in the Eastern Conference. Their offseason moves didn’t floor anyone, but they do appear to have improved, both on the bench and in the coaching box. The head coach position is where Chicago made their most substantial move: out went Frank Klopas after last season, and in came <em>*Frank Yallop. </em></em>Yallop won two <span class="caps">MLS</span> Cups with the San Jose Earthquakes as well as the 2012 Supporters’ Shield, so he certainly has pedigree to match that of his new&nbsp;employer.</p>
