          <section class="content"><p>Hey guys and gals. You like Major League Soccer, right? Of course you do! Why else would you be here? And how do you feel about contests? Fun, right? And what would a contest be without a fabulous prize? Well, American Soccer Analysis will be running a prediction contest over the first two weeks of the 2014 <span class="caps">MLS</span> season, and <strong>the winner will receive a subscription to <span class="caps">MLS</span> LIVE</strong> for the 2014 season. Here’s how it will work… On both Monday, March 3 and Monday, March 10, American Soccer Analysis will post 10 questions about the forthcoming week’s Major League Soccer and <span class="caps">CONCACAF</span> Champions League games. Just follow us on Twitter, use your master prognostication abilities, submit your answers using our form, and whoever has the most correct total answers after the second week of games will win a subscription to MLS LIVE for this season. It’s that easy. (Well, except for the tiebreaker, which will be asked in week two in the event that multiple people finish with the same score.) Do you have to be following <a href="https://twitter.com/AnalysisEvolved">@AnalysisEvolved</a> on Twitter to win the prize? Yes. Is this a shameful attempt to drive traffic to our Twitter and consequently this website? No. We feel lots of shame in doing so, but do so we must! Remember, <strong>only followers of <a href="https://twitter.com/AnalysisEvolved">@AnalysisEvolved</a></strong> on Twitter will be eligible for the subscription to <span class="caps">MLS</span> Live 2014. The MLS LIVE subscription is transferrable, so if you’re already registered for this season, and you win, you can always re-gift it to a friend, or family member, or enemy who has an irrational hate for soccer. See you on&nbsp;Monday!</p>
