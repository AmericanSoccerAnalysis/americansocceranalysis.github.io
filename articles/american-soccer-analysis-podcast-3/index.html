          <section class="content"><p>Hello, there, you fine traveller… if you are of a west coast bias you’ll love today’s show. First I have to say I’m really sadden by the fact that neither myself nor Matty worked in a “Third” joke with as much as we like to talk about cutting the field into thirds with this being our third podcast. <em>sigh</em> it didn’t happen, maybe we’ll save the jokes for episode 33. Anyways… we have the following for you. - We chronicle the life and times of your’s truly, me, Harrison Crow, and little background as to why I created the site - We talk a bit about possession stats, why they’re important, why they are not and how they are sometimes misleading. I referenced a <a href="http://www.optasportspro.com/en/about/optapro-blog/posts/2012/possession%28s%29.aspx">blog post by Opta</a> during this conversation… please take a look it has a lot of really good information. I’m trying to come up with a bunch of material for a post later on today. I hope you all check it out. - We do mention Montreal and their Italian influenced defense/counter-attack system and how it’s helped them to a 2<span class="ord">nd</span> place start in the Eastern Conference - Next, we chronicle the poor start to the Sounders and why their possession stats are so high, yet have produced no goals. We also mention a bit about Sporting Kansas City and the <span class="caps">LA</span> Galaxy, as well as the Portland Timbers and their dominance in possession. - We use the segue of the Portland Timbers to talk a little bit about Will Johnson…underrated pick-up, amazing goals, and his ability to troll on Alan Gordon. Yep, he’s gone for 3 games. Gordon, not Johnson… <img src="http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BH3q2uOCcAAYBNy.png" alt=""> And for those of you who didn’t catch his brilliant goal, at home, which in turn gave the Timbers 3-points, check it out below: [youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHMV-zPqccc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHMV-zPqccc</a>] - Lastly we talked about our “game-of-the-week” which we selected Sporting Kansas City and Los Angeles Galaxy. While separated by 7 points in the table—and more specifically 2 games in hand by <span class="caps">LA</span>—-Tempo-Free Soccer has them ranked 1 and 2. We make our picks for who we like, why, and a few little facts to back it up. This podcast is a bit longer than usual at 45 mins, I hope you enjoy!
