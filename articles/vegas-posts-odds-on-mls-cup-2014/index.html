          <section class="content"><p>I’m not usually interested in sports betting. I think most would find that surprising because we run an analytics site, and most analytics fit jointly, at least in Europe, with gambling. I avoid gambling for numerous reasons, but in general because I like the money I have and would hate to lose it.  However, there is a bit of value in looking at the betting lines and understanding which teams are favorites and why. It can give us a bit of early insight into who people consider “the best” teams. In case you missed it, Las Vegas odd makers metaphorically walked to the front of the class room and posted the first pre-season grades, identifying who they believe to the best teams in <span class="caps">MLS</span>. Basically they painted big red targets on the back of the LA Galaxy and Sporting Kansas City going forward. Here is a little snap shot of the complete lines, <a href="http://prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com/2014/01/27/early-odds-for-2014-mls-cup-champions-are-out/">courtesy of Steve Davis and NBCSports</a>. <img src="http://nbcprosoccertalk.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/mls-cup-odds.png" alt=""> Here are few things that pop out at me just looking at this list. First, the <span class="caps">LA</span> Galaxy are a club that we liked a lot going into the MLS Cup. We ranked them second in terms of the probability of winning the Supporters Shield and then third in the likelihood of winning the end of season tournament. Being cast aside by Real Salt Lake in the first round was not unimaginable, and yet it kind of took us all back for a moment. It’s not surprising to me that they probably hoist the imaginary pre-season trophy at this point. Second, Portland and Seattle are neck and neck in odds. If you thought the rivalry between these two I-5 teams culminated with the playoff match, you have another thing coming. This season is going to be rife with parity, and the difference between the 1<span class="ord">st</span> seed and the 5<span class="ord">th</span> could be substantially less than what it’s been in a number of years. This is only going to throw more wood on the fire for clubs like Seattle and Portland, creating an even more tension filled stadium. Oh, hey Vancouver, you’re there also… your just not “there” yet. Third, Toronto goes from being on the worst teams in the league to big signings and having the 8<span class="ord">th</span> best odds to come home with silverware at the end of the season. The tides look on the brink of turning in the Queen City and could yield a very fun summer for the Reds. Some thing well deserved for their fans with the incredible support shown through some disappointing years, and really since their arrival to MLS in 2008. Lastly, who could blame you if really you wanted to throw five dollars down on DC United. Eddie Johnson/Fabian Espindola, a rebuilt back line, and young potential US internationals in Perry Kitchen and Bill Hamid. 50-1 odds? Heck, I may just throw 20 dollars on them and become a season long United&nbsp;fan.</p>
